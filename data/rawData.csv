As of today, I am still unsure of the major I wish to pursue in college, but I am strongly considering Computer Science. Since I am a high school junior and will be applying to colleges in the fall, I would truly appreciate learning about Computer Science in order to help me decide what I want to study. Because I am interested in the process of making video games, Computer Science would be the most interesting field for me. I want to participate in this specific summer program because of its ability to reach out to men of color from low-income backgrounds who, like me, may not have access to many programs that encourage education in technology. I haven’t met many people who have pursued a career in Computer Science, and I would be grateful for the mentor-ship of people who study or work in the field. Because the All Star Code Summer Intensive takes place in the Microsoft and Goldman Sachs buildings, I would get the opportunity to interact with the people who work for these companies. I would be able to talk to the Computer Scientists who give talks and presentations to the students who are part of the Summer Intensive, which would help me become more certain of the career path I wish to follow.","Personally, I find technology to be very exciting because of how it constantly changes the world. Since the majority of the things I do in my life involve the use of technology, it has become a major part of my life, and it has made me the person I am. Every time I see a new technological advancement, I try to imagine the countless amount of time spent developing it, and the countless ways in which it will affect the world. For instance, when videogames first came out, and even now, they were simply a means to pass the time; however, gaming has also become a lifestyle for many people, a full-time job for others, and a way to prove one’s uniqueness and skillfulness as a talented professional gamer in the world of eSports. This type of life changing development is something I want to be involved in. Some areas that I am interested in are software development, videogame development, and virtual reality (VR). I am interested in software and videogame development because I play many videogames. I find it rather fascinating that games are created through lines upon lines of code. I am interested in VR because I believe that it will completely change most industries in the world, from medical practice to education. For example, Oculus Rift can be used to bring the virtual and real world closer than ever. The world that was once viewed only through a monitor can now be interacted with using one’s body.","If money were no object, I would go to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and major in Computer Science. While I am still unsure if Computer Science is the field I want to pursue, I believe this area of study would be most enjoyable for a gamer like me. The professors at MIT have years of experience and great dedication to their field, and I would appreciate being able to learn from such amazing people. Also, MIT can provide many resources to its students that not all other colleges can provide. This is because MIT's prestigious status enables it to afford having these resources. The obstacles that prevent me from achieving my dream are mostly financial issues. Meeting the requirements to enter MIT is extremely difficult, especially the test scores and tuition. Because of my family’s income, having a tutor or taking preparation courses for the SAT is difficult. Because of this, I have been studying independently in hopes of being able to get good grades and a high SAT score. As a member of a low-income family, paying for such a prestigious college is not a simple matter, if at all possible. Even if I do manage to get financial aid, it is not certain that my family would be able to afford the remaining cost of tuition, textbooks, and other expenses. ","Unfortunately, my last summer was extremely dull. Although my summer was dull, there were several interesting and eye-opening experiences. The majority of my last summer I was preparing for the SAT and studying to retake Regents Exams for test scores I wanted to improve. In the time I was not studying, I was playing videogames and watching anime. Although I do consider my last summer to be rather dull, I do believe that playing videogames, watching anime, and studying for the regents were very important to me. Videogames were important to me because playing them is the one thing I can still do with my friends from Egypt; in other words, it is what is keeping our friendships alive. This is why I treasure videogames. Watching anime was important because I can find characters who I can relate to and fascinating stories. Studying was important because it was a reality check. Before last summer, I did not know how to study and I thought studying was boring. Still, I got decent grades. When I used the summer to learn how to study, I realized that studying can be fun if I want it to be, which opened the path for me to become a better student.","Last semester in Pre-Calculus, the teacher assigned a self-portrait project. For this project, we simply had to create equations to graph our self-portraits and then explain why we picked the self-portrait we picked. At first, I thought this would be a simple project that would not take much time. Sometime after the project was assigned, I started brainstorming ideas of what I would do for my self-portrait. Then I realized I could not think of anything that represented me as a person. After a moment of being surprised, I start asked my friends for their opinions, only to receive vague responses that were not helpful. Eventually, I asked my mother what she thought because she knows me better than any other person. She said, with tint of surprise, “What about that videogame you always play with your friends?” I thought she was joking and proceeded to enter my room to ponder even more, but I soon realized that her idea was spot-on. Gaming has shaped my life, specifically Defense of the Ancients 2 (DOTA 2) because of the immense amount of strategies and ways to play the game. It helped me keep in contact with my friends in Egypt and it helped me create my social life. The rest of the project was simply a matter of graphing, creating equations, and writing about how DOTA 2 is my self-portrait, which was easier after coming up with my self-portrait.","Over the years, my answer for this question has changed. It is mostly a matter of whether or not I have a team I can depend on to work through problems. I become extremely frustrated when I have a team that simply uses me to do the entire group project without any of their help. On the other hand, I wholeheartedly welcome a team that I can work with, that will share opinions, and that will collaborate to create a finished project. When it comes to programming projects, having a team with a similar goal and level of determination allows for the accomplishment of a project that is better than anything any one person can do alone. For example, if I am writing a HTML code that I believe should work, but does not, having another pair of eyes to look at my code helps with fixing errors that are often hard to notice when staring at a piece of code for a long time. Another benefit of teamwork is the development of ideas through communication. As a team, people can communicate their ideas and improve them based on the feedback of the other members. Overall, having a team can help me grow as a person and a programmer. As a beginner in programming, I have so much to learn and I hope that working with others, who may be more experienced programmers, will help contribute towards my growth as a programmer.",5,Yes,auelsayed@gmail.com,239428973,auelsayed@gmail.com,Abdelrahman Elsayed,Abdelrahman Elsayed,,,1,Abdelrahman Elsayed,Google,3,7,8,Athena,"HTML, CSS, JS, python, APIs, back-end",,,,Research,,Tech,0

I love to meet new people, to learn more about new cultures and the Summer Intensive program produces a very good chance for me to do that. It also will allow me to learn more about computer science which is a topic that I am very interested in and a topic that I may practice in college.","What really excites me about technology is the fact that you can always improve something in the field no matter what. There is no end to technology, it just keeps on getting better. As a part of the new generation, I get to see the many new improvements and advancements in technology. I remember when many people used to flaunt the fact that they had a SideKick, which was a popular phone in the mid 2000s, and now they flaunt their new iPhone 6+ or Samsung Note 3. In about a decade you can instantly tell the change in technology when it came to phones and the fun fact about it is that it will only get better as time passes. I'm interested in software engineering and computer science because those fields have a lot of promise in the world today. Within those fields, you can change a lot about technology by creating new ideas and plans for new commodities. ","If money were no object, I would love to go to MIT. As I was growing up I had a book about Leonardo, the famous Furry Robot, who was mainly created by Cynthia Breazeal who is now a professor. I have a huge fascination for robots due to the fact that we live in a world where everybody needs help. I had a dream where I created a robot that had the purpose of saving animals in floods based off of the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. I would love to study computer engineering due to the fact that I want to create a software where it can be applied to robots to make it do a desired action that can be used to save lives. The only obstacles that might prevent me in any way can be my determination and hunger to study that topic. However, as of right now I am beyond eager and very willing to learn more about this topic. ",Last summer I had attended summer school to finish some mandatory classes needed to complete high school such as health. I did it so I don't have to take it during my school year and so it doesn't waste a period of school for me. This was very important for me because Junior year of my high school career was the most important time for me. Colleges look very heavily on what I do in the year so I have to have sufficient time to finish all of my work diligently and correctly so that I could've gotten the best grades I possibly could've. I really want to go to a good college and get a good job so the added free time helped ease my way into accomplishing my Junior year of high school. ,"So in my Junior year of high school, I struggled mightily with Physics. I was doing very bad on many tests and it was due to the fact that I couldn't grasp the whole concept behind the various topics. In physics there are many instances where there might be two options in terms of formulas to use to solve the problem and it was hard to distinguish which one to use because they were so similar. So I had talked to my teacher about some extra time to work with me on various problems so I can understand the concepts behind the problems. He agreed and we met afterschool at three o'clock every Tuesday to get more one on one time to understand the concepts. As a result, the next three tests I did very well and it helped boost my average to the high 80s. ","I prefer working as a team because teamwork gets a lot more accomplished when everybody is working together compared to a lone wolf trying to accomplish the same task. Working as a team just brings along better vibes because you are communicating with each other, having fun, but also finishing the task together. Working solo takes out the fun aspect to the task. Think about it like this: imagine you are playing a basketball game with your team against another team. The goal is to have more points than the other team. If a lone individual was to score all of the points for one team, what fun is that for everybody else. If everybody gets in on the action then it'll be fun and everybody goes and has a chance to score. That's why I love to work as part of a team: to have fun while accomplishing the same goals as my teammates.",5,Yes,rafia@bxscience.edu,239414001,rafia@bxscience.edu,Abu Rafi,Abu Rafi,,,1,Abu Rafi,Google,0,4,N/A,Travel Buddy (Artificial World),"Python, physical computing","Focus, distracts others",Combining CS and music,,Focus,Tech,,0

Even from a young age, computers have fascinated me. No one in my family or among my friends truly understood those machines, but I slowly broadened my understanding of both computer hardware and programming by using books I found at the library. Now, my yearning for more knowledge can only be satisfied by the lessons and mentorship offered by the All Star Code Summer Intensive.
   I hope to use my burning passion for the computer sciences to gain the skills I need to begin a life of programming, engineering, and overall tech entrepreneurship. This program is offering an opportunity for me to do something I could only wait until college to study. I can learn the fundamentals I need to pursue a life of creating or improving some piece of technology. I believe All Star Code offers a program with benefits that no college degree could match. This program will certainly inspire me to contribute to a field of computer science, and dispel any notion that I, with training, cannot develop innovative technology on my own. ","   Our world has no shortage of problems, but lacks vast quantities of tools. Most lifeforms must evolve over thousands of generations to adapt to the challenges of nature. Technology is mankind's way of artificially adapting to an environment exponentially faster than what natural selection and random mutation could do. However, the technology used in computers have problems and tools  that it needs on its own. The seemingly limitless application of these tools used by computers excites me about technology.
   Within the realm of computer programming, creating applications that the average user can use to improve his or her life is what interests me the most. One particular application I would love to work on, given the recent controversy over the FBI and Apple, is creating a secondary encryption scheme on top of Apple's for particularly sensitive data. I would work on this subject because I am very interested in cyber security.
   The ability to create tools to either enhance or simplify some time consuming task into a computer program is something else that interests me in computer programming. The calculator alone, after years of improvement, has completely changed the way people crunch large numbers. Accounting and various other careers became far less time consuming, allowing for more time to work on other tasks. Thus, I am interested in simplifying people's lives through programming.   ","    If money were no object, I would love to go to Stanford University, since it has arguably the best technology courses and programs in the world. I would be studying computer programming, along with cyber security.
    Computer programming gives one the tools necessary to write code that could either drastically improve some time or resources consuming task, or a game that can keep millions of users entertained. I, as a member of a society that relies so heavily on computer software to accomplish the simplest of tasks, such as writing this essay, ought to understand that software, and offer improvements if necessary. I can also attempt to create entirely new software for the same task, writing essays, but an emphasis on something else, such as design.
    I addition to computer programming, I would study cyber security because I want to learning more about the way the technology I trust upon remains secure. If I remain ignorant, that will not only probably leave me susceptible to compromising my security, I will not be able to contribute to society some improvement in the way we keep our devices and data secure.
    Technology is constantly improving and becoming more advanced as each day passes, so I must be constantly researching it and improving my own skills. This obstacle may prevent me from achieving that dream, but it is also the reason why I want to develop these skills. I believe I can offer something new and useful to society. ","    Last summer I was part of the Lawrenceville Scool's exchange student program with the Keio School in Japan. This program, simply put, prepared me to become a global-class citizen.
   I hosted a scholarship partner from the Keio School. I was amazed at how quickly, and enthusiastically my dorm accepted their new member. However, it was the second part of this program, when I was a guest in Yokohama, that I truly learned to be a global citizen. I didn't just learn to travel without my own parents, which  was a foreign experience on its own; I became far more independent as I made most of the choices about what to do during my stay. At the school, many of the students I met were willing to engage in conversation about how Japanese and Western, or American, cultures differ. The class I was with had various, gregarious students. The teachers that had me always found a way to make the most of our presence by having me participate with the class or discuss the Lawrenceville School and my culture. The excursions lead by some of the schoolteachers were full of fun and enlightening experiences.
   This program was important to me because I learned how to think with a different mindset and view of the world. The exchange was like a training ground for my mind to learn how to adapt to another culture and be exposed to new ideas. As I made these journeys, I realized that Japan is a world so far yet near to ours. I found people I could laugh and smile with there just like at home. "," My 9th grade summer, I set out on a personal project to create a business specifically for the young performers in my local area looking for a way to gain exposure while being paid for their time. Many performers do not have the finances available for advertising or are fortunate enough to gain exposure without money. Thus, they typically go on public transportation or to other public areas to gain some money for their talents. However, the money earned is not consistent, and many students simply cannot sacrifice as much time as older performers can. Therefore, I tried to raise funds to offer planned events specifically tailored to young performers so they may earn the money they may need to continue pursuing their talents.
  The challenge came in two parts. The first one was funding. I have only set up lemonade stands a few times during elementary school, and now had to raise far more money than five dollars a day to make this start up to be successful. I had to either sell tickets at public events, or have customers pay for private performances, which quickly became far more complicated than I imagined. Secondly, I needed to find performers interested enough in my idea to form my company. After speaking with over a dozen performers on the 7 train, I failed to interest anyone of them.
   I abandoned this idea as September approached, but oddly became a lot more interested in entrepreneurship. While I failed this one time, I now have more new ideas to invest my time in.","  Depending on the task, I will choose to work solo or part of a team. I believe working as part of a team is essential for any project, due to its complexity. However, once this project is broken up into smaller, simpler tasks, I prefer working solo.
   Working as part a team significantly reduces the amount of time and energy necessary to complete a project. Thus, other projects can begin sooner, allowing more work to be produced in a given amount of time than what a single person can do. In addition, I tend to be the ""bonder"" in each team, or the person who keeps everyone together. I have even dealt with projects where my partners despised each other but I was able to keep those emotions away from work. When teammates support each other, they are encouraged to work even more. Thus, teamwork is not only essential, but highly beneficial for the health of a project. As a more personal reason, I see projects not just as an opportunity to create or research something new, but also as an unforgettable memory of struggle and triumph shared amongst my teammates.
   Naturally, I prefer working solo for simple tasks. Writing a piece of code that is just part of a larger program should be done independently, and then reviewed with peers afterwards. In this way, we can all work on several pieces of code to construct our program at the same time, thus speeding up the process.

A good friend of mine, currently a high school senior, told me that he planned to go to college but he was not sure of what field(s) he would study. His words made me recognize that I want to be able to use my coding skills to create a company where I create mobile and web applications based on my many ideas. I want to explore the tech field and graduate college with a degree in computer science and another in economics. Being a part of the ASC summer program will enable me to pursue my dreams because I will learn the skills and forge the connections necessary to build myself up. Even though I have already spent time learning and programming in Java and Lua (and subsequently developing an app that I intend to release on app stores soon), I want to expand my coding abilities. Having heard of the many widespread usability and power of Python, I wish to code more with the language through ASC. On top of that, I wish to rekindle my love and interest in robotics which I am aware is something offered in the ASC summer program. Most of all, participating in the ASC program will enable me to meet new and old tech entrepreneurs for advice on how I can start and establish my own company while connecting with other intelligent and tech-savvy kids.","	Many people say they are interested in technology, but I specifically am interested in the most common technology people use today and how it affects a vast majority of the world. I am incredibly excited about how major technology’s grip and effect on mankind has been. In present day, most people in modern nations use smartphones, tablets, computers, and other forms of technology to stay connected. We get our news, weather, games, messages, and other resources all from phones in our hands. Technology has influenced many parts of our lives. The widespread influence smartphones and the web has on society makes me interested in developing mobile apps and websites. For example, I have been developing a repetitive and addicting mobile game to test out how successful similar games have been on app stores. My app involves a majority of coding in Lua and Java, but I am also interested in developing web applications with Python and HTML. Creating software that is important and affects its users is what I want to do. For example, the launch of new music streaming services has been slowly killing the entire idea of purchasing music. Many people use Spotify and/or Soundcloud now for music. Similarly, Facebook and social media has changed the entire idea of how humans communicate with one another. Software such as that, less than 50 MB to download on Android, has affected the entire world. That is the kind of thing I want to do, that is the kind of thing I am interested in."," 	Out of all of the colleges in the world, I would go to Stanford. Stanford University is a prestigious and well-known academic institution, and I specifically wish to attend there to study computer science and economics. Studying computer science would make me a better programmer which then gives me a better ability to bring my ideas into reality. Studying economics would give me a greater understanding of the world economy and how I can financially support my company when I actually establish it. The incredibly rigorous and powerful academics of Stanford are exactly what I want and need to gain enough knowledge to establish my own technology corporation. On top of that, Stanford has many alumni who have gone on to found multibillion-dollar tech companies such as Google and Instagram. Many Stanford graduates go on to work at Google, Apple, and other major technology corporations. Being a Stanford graduate can make it easier for me to connect with other graduates in said companies. The school’s location close to Silicon Valley enables me to study and maintain relationships with tech titans. Obstacles that can prevent me from achieving that dream, however, would simply be rejection from the university.
","	Last summer, I attended an iD Game Studios and Development Academy. Located in Vassar College, the summer camp lasted two weeks and was basically an intense course that taught me a lot about the ropes of game development. This experience started off from playing around with 3d modeling software such as Maya to creating playable levels in Unreal Engine. However, it wasn’t the knowledge I gained from this experience that truly made going to the camp important. It was the people I met. Being a teenager from a not so financially well off family going to an elite $50,000 a year boarding school on a scholarship, I lived in a bubble. Boarding school was full of people who were generally different but all came from similar backgrounds. Many of my friends had never faced real struggle. But at iD Game Studios, I met people from all different walks of life. One person at the summer camp was a 17-year old who told me his parents won’t support him through college even though they have the money once he turns 18. I met another teenager, only 14 years old, who had been struggling with the death of his father. So many people from incredible backgrounds who had faced so much suffering truly impacted me. I became grateful for the many opportunities I had, and the experience helped inspire my drive to succeed.
","	When I finished my freshman year in high school, I had to choose the courses I planned to take during my sophomore year. Being an excited overachiever, I pounced at the opportunity to take AP (Advanced Placement) Chemistry. It was a course normally reserved for upperclassmen due to its difficulty. I thought that I could handle the course, but the first semester of my sophomore year was scarred with grades not as high as I was used to. For weeks I could not understand why I wasn’t doing so well in AP Chemistry. I found myself starting to study weeks in advance for tests but also pulling Red Bull-fueled all-nighters right before to strengthen my understanding. The entire experience was emotionally and mentally draining for me. I had always been used to effortlessly getting high grades in math and science, and suddenly I was putting in dozens of hours of effort with no avail. Worst of all, I had a reputation for being an overachiever in my school and felt embarrassed at the idea of people knowing what my grades were. At some point, I had a long talk with my teacher and confessed how I felt. From there, I started to meet with him regularly and managed my time better. My grades began to improve, and I stopped caring about whether or not people judged me for my grades. Most of all, however, I learned to not overestimate my own abilities. I bit off more than I can chew without AP Chem, but this failure has led to many lessons to apply to my future endeavors.","	Personally, I have no preference when it comes to working solo or as part of a team. That is because I have worked many times in both scenarios and have been successful in each and every one. When I work individually, I can manage myself, guide myself, and make good judgement calls myself. An example of this would be when I am working on my app. I have divided up times of the week that I spend working on my app, and I have set goals I accomplish each coding session. I code, dabble in graphics art, and do research by myself to produce my app. When I am working as part of a team, my work is solid and quality because I can play any role in a team. I can follow whatever directions are given to me and produce great results. But I can also play the role of a leader and manage the entire team. As a person I am generally amiable and nice, so I almost never have any disputes with members of my teams and can often form relationships quickly.

Some of the opportunity they give kids like me is we can be able to get head start on computer science. I would love to get an opportunity on computer science since my school doesn't offer it and it falls in with my major which is computer and math. With an opportunity like this not only does this help me get ahead of most people who want to be involved with computer science but it also helps me get very good internships from very big companies,which is what I heard from the Alumni. If I am able to get an internship from a company like Google not only does it help me improve my resume which will look good on my college application, but it will also help me in the future when I am looking for a job and can't find one they will be able to help. Another reason why I want to be apart of this program is that I just love doing stuff like this, who doesn't want an experience like this when you are with regular students like yourself and get the experience that a lot of people would want to do for free. Not only does this help me get closer to college but it also helps me build up my leadership skills and how companies like Google, Facebook, Instagram, and etc actually work. Finally the last reason why I want to do this once again is because not only do I love this subject, but this is what I want to do for the rest of my life. I just love computer science.","The thing that really excites me about technology is really technology it's self, for example nobody would've never imagine that people would be able to create all these new inventions we have right now. And to top it off technology is still expanding and new invention are being created day after day. One of best new inventions that I loved this year was the hoverbord, I just like how you could move on something without doing anything at all. When I tried to use the hover board it felt like I was going to fall off and hurt myself. But if I am able to master riding that I would love to use that everyday even going to school. Also the thing that excites me more is that you guys are giving me the opportunity to be able to create something like this or even better we might be able to meet the guys who made it. This gives me an opportunity to ask questions that I never asked before since I didn't have the opportunity. I would also like to create my own Mobile Application, for example I be hearing about all of these new Social Media apps that everybody are using even celebrities. But wouldn't it be cool if I can be able to create my own social media apps and maybe it might end up reaching the top. Wouldn't it be awesome if I was like the creator of Facebook or maybe even YouTube. It would be so awesome if somebody ask me are you the creator of YouTube and I can say yes I am.","If money was no object and I can go to any college that I want. I would want to go to Villanova University because that's the college I always wanted to go since I was in the eight grade and it majors in math which is what I am very good at. But now since you guys said money is not an object I might change my mind and I would want to go to MIT since it is one of the best university in the world and I believe it is the best university for technology, so why not go to one the greatest ones in the world. And especially since it is based on technology that means that it's an obvious choice for anybody who is into technology. If they are obstacles that would prevent me from being able to achieve that dream would be my peers who would also be applying for that college and since money is not a problem the number of people that would apply to MIT would be a huge number. Then that would go down to the resume and SAT scores. For me SAT scores won't be a problem,but what would be a problem would be my resume. My resume isn't that bad, but if it is compared to other people's resumes then that would be a problem. That is also one of the reason why I want to be in this program is that it would improve my resume and make me a better applicant for colleges that are based on Computer Science and Math. Imagine how many colleges would want me to be part of their community if they see that I have this kind of experience that most people won't have before entering college they would want me.","Well last summer for me was a very rough summer for me. One of the things that I had to do during the summer was fasting, since I am Muslim and it was the month of Ramadan I had to fast for thirty days, which is basically not eating from sunrise all the way to sunset. It also includes drinking water which meant that I couldn't eat or drink from that time during the hot summer. Was it a hard challenge, Yes but I like to push myself to the limits. On top of fasting I was also playing on my basketball team and I couldn't drink water during practice which was very tough. Not only did my coach respect that but he also made the other player do it as well and not only did it made me feel like everybody else but it also made our team better and we made it very far in the playoffs. That's when my coach thanked me for this kind of experience for the player, but my teammates also thanked me which surprised me because I thought they would be made but they found the results very amazing. Also another thing that I did during the summer was that I was learning Arabic and memorizing the Qur'an. Some people think learning new languages is easy but try learning Arabic and you might quit on the second day. When they was teaching me how to learn Arabic I thought it would be easy but boy was I wrong. This language made Spanish look like crawling. I learned to read and write it which is good. I also memorized the Qur'an which isn't easy cause some people can't even memorize books in English.","The time I struggled with something was during the summers and it was when I thought I was so smart that I should try memorizing the Qur'an and learn Arabic at the same time, when I first started it didn't look as hard as I thought it would be, but boy was I wrong. The thing that was hard about learning Arabic is that you have learn twenty eight new letters and the hard part about it is that the alphabets are very weird and they make different sound. Am to top it off each letter can make like three different sounds. Imagine if you are trying to figure out which sound the letter makes. Also the hard part about Arabic is that one mistake can make change the entire meaning of the word, so if you mispronounce a word you might be saying something else and that might make you look like a fool around everybody else. The other hard experience I did was trying to memorized the Qur'an. It really isn't that easy to memorized a book that is entirely in Arabic, but since I was learning Arabic and memorizing the Qur'an at the same time it was kind of hard but helpful at the same time since I was able to learn how to read and write it fast. If somebody ask me to read the Qur'an on any page I could be able to do it, but if they're ask me to memorize the whole Qur'an then I don't think I could be able to do it. But I already did memorize some of the pages in the Qur'an, like about 100 pages. Was it a rough experience, yes it was but it was worth it because it made my resume better for college","I would prefer working as part of a team because if you are with a team not only do you guys have a lot of ideas floating around, you also have other people who could help you if you are lost and need help. If somebody picks to wok solo I would understand why they chose that is maybe because they don't like Working with other people since they might be as smart as them or they might have different ideas that they wouldn't like. But if they think about it most successful ideas weren't made solo. Like for example, Facebook and some of other social media websites weren't created by just one person they were created by more than one. It would've been maybe a whole group of people who created the whole idea and even now they might still be a group of people who still are adding new ideas to Facebook and other sites. Also if you don't practice being in a group and working well with people then it would help you in the future. My teachers told me that you must be able to work with other people before you get to college because team work skills is very important in life. For examples, when you grow up and your trying to get a job you have to be able to have those skills because if you don't know how  to work with other people then maybe they won't be able to pick you for the job since you might have trouble with your coworkers. Therefore, I believe that working as part of a team is way better than solo since it helps you improve your team work skills and will be helpful in the future",4,Yes,alphabah212@gmail.com,242430197,alphabah212@gmail.com,,,,checked,1,Alpha Bah,MLB,2,8,7,Super Climate Change,"HTML, CSS, JS, research, Game Maker Studio",Quiet,"Engineering Degree, with a pursuit in music and design",,Quiet,Non-Tech,Tech,0

I've visited various websites in an attempt to self-teach. These websites simply told you what to do and practically did it for you, and that was not much use or fun to me. I feel the All Star Code Summer Intensive would be a great place to learn how to code and so much more than a website might deliver.","There are two main aspects that really excite me about technology, which are AI and game design. AI interests me because it is incredible to see a program reciprocate the same actions as a human would, especially in games. Game design also interests me because after coding and programming, everything from the characters to the setting comes to life and they all contribute to the game. I aspire to learn and code my own games in order to recreate this excitement for others.","Although I am interested in and will be attending college, I have not decided which college I will be attending. However, I will attend a college that offers programming, game design, and/or media classes. Programming and game design go together, so it would fulfill a life-long dream of mine to learn to design and program my own games. I also would like to go to a college which offers some media classes, such as photography and film-making because those are some of my interests right now. Going to college is important to me so I will make sure that no obstacle stands in my way, besides money of course.","Last summer, my family and I went white-water rafting and it was amazing. I think the main reason that it was a lot of fun was because I was with people that I loved. When we first got into the raft, we had a little trouble learning how to control it. Within a few minutes we figured out that there were four jobs, just enough for the four of us. One person had to act as the rudder of a boat with their paddle and sit in the back, two people had to paddle to move the raft forward or backwards and sit in the middle, and the final person had to sit in the front and direct us from crashing into rocks. We each cycled through the different jobs and found which one fit us best. Eventually, we all agreed that my mother worked best as the rudder, my father and I worked best as the propelling forces of the raft, and my sister worked best as the person in charge of watching out for rocks. I think the fun and the teamwork made this experience a lot more enjoyable than it would've been rafting alone.","In my freshmen year of high school, I struggled in my Design, Drafting, and Production (DDP) class even though I got excellent grades in all other classes. The material was confusing and my teacher wasn't always clear when explaining it. I went to tutoring and studied whenever I could, from train rides to bedtime, but I simply didn't understand the material. After months of studying, and even watching YouTube videos in an attempt to teach myself, I finally understood the class work. I eventually I became so comfortable with the material that I was able to explain and clarify the lesson to other struggling students. My confidence in this class improved greatly after a project in which we had to design a 3 x 3 puzzle cube.  I worked on this project for a week without rest because I was determined to make a change and break the pattern of confusion in this class. The teacher complimented my puzzle by saying it was one of the best in the class, which felt extremely validating. She gave me a 95 which was the highest grade I'd ever received in that class. After struggling in this class, I studied and worked even harder than I did before and that initiative had a positive effect on my life. For example, in my current Digital Electronics (DE) class, which is the advanced course that follows DDP, the teacher recently chose me to teach the class on Fridays while he checks students’ notes. ","I like to work as a part of a team because when working solo, you have control of what you’ll do but your product may be limited to the creativity of only your mind. When working as a team, more ideas are shared and with each idea expressed, you expand the limits of creativity and what the final product might be.  At the same time, you learn something about your team, and can even build friendships.

Duke has produced many notable alumni such as Tim Cook and Melinda Gates.

I believe it was important to me as I went through what most camps would call a CIT program. When I was there I earned my First Aid Certificate and CPR certificate.

The reason why it was so important to me was because I,"Since last year I've been struggling with geometry with the my average dropping from 81 to my highest only being an 85. I've tried to tackle this matter and I'm still struggling with it. My current geometry grade is 84 and I am trying to break my barrier of 85. My overall average would be a lot higher if I had a higher grade in geometry. Geometry doesn't seem to click with me. I try to understand certain theorems and i doesn't click in my brain.

First and foremost, I love collaborating with other people, and am willing to put in the necessary time to be successful.  I always dreamed of being successful and the head of my own business, but never knew where exactly to start.  In this day and age of technology, I feel All Star Code will not only give me an edge over my peers, but allow me to put my dreams into fruition.  Math and science have always been my favorite subjects, and networking with African-American engineers that have proved themselves; in a society that lacks black engineers, will allow me to sharpen my skills both mentally and physically, and show me anything can be accomplished.  All Star Code is a platform that will give me first-hand experience in the tech industry, and connections that I can implement in my daily life.  I always tell myself, actions speak louder than words; and taking advantage of opportunities like this intensive program, success is inevitable.  I understand this will not be easy; but, solving a problems step by step, and staying in the moment is the only way I can move forward.
","Technology excites me in many ways, as it serves many purposes and is constantly changing and improving.  In this modern day society, technology has become a dual part of people’s life, as it’s incorporated in everything from driving a car, taking a train, using a cell phone, or watching television.  Although; technology is such a vast area of study, that at times seeing how fast the world is innovating, it could be a little overwhelming to see what else can be done.  In particular, I am intrigued with what technology has to offer.  Such as the factors involving communication, the visuals, hands-on interactions, and its job in making the world more efficient.  As an African-American male, I feel it’s my duty to innovate, be at the top and give back; ultimately changing societies norms and expectations, because people that look just like me will not and should not continue to be suppressed and given the bare minimum.  Over the years, I’ve been blessed to be on several robotics teams, and work on STEM field projects.  These opportunities, have broadened my horizon to the world of mechanical and software engineering, which is what I feel most connected with.  I always thought it was cool to play video games and watch movies, but I think it’s so much more beneficial to know how to make these products myself.
","If money were no object, I would go to college at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology or MIT. I would study Software Engineering, because it is a field that will allow me to innovate and create code; hand in hand with what I feel I can implement in society. I like being well-rounded, and basketball is a way I like relieving stress.  With software engineering, the world of basketball can ultimately come to life, with brainstorming something I think basketball lovers can relate to in the tech industry, and put it into existence.  MIT is one of the top engineering schools America has to offer, so my skills would be sharpened; and, knowing there would be no financial burden would remove the burden of stress .  Despite this opportunity sounding great, money is in fact a reality that would prevent me from achieving my dream.  Nothing in life is free, and college comes with student loans and other expenses that my mom as a single parent would have to assist in.  I look at this predicament as an obstacle, because my mom shouldn’t have to worry about me financially as hard as she works; and, I know I am more than capable of gaining scholarships.  Lastly, just being African-American in general, the system is not in my favor, and therefore I have to work twice as hard to see results.  For example, only 10% of MIT’s freshman rate for 2019 is African-American, as opposed to 51% for caucasians; but, I challenge myself to overcome these obstacles.  If that means studying more, staying","Last summer, I took advantage of a six week intensive STEM program known as ARISE or Applied Innovations in Science and Engineering.  This program which took place at the NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering was highly competitive, and gave me exposure that I will never forget.  As the youngest person in the program, I felt an obligation to absorb as much information as possible, and use it to the best of my ability.  There was a series of engineering labs people could choose from, and I was selected to the Soil Mechanics lab along with another student.  Me and my peer were partnered with Phd candidates in the Civil Engineering field of Soil Mechanics; and worked hand in hand on executing a final project.  My goal was to test a new technology of a Fiber Reinforced Plastic Pile, and see its effect on the foundation and support of buildings, as opposed to the steel piles used everyday.  I drilled and tested several samples of pile, to eventually see how much strain and resistance it could ultimately take.  This data was collected in excel spread sheets and displayed in charts, which I presented in front of NYU funders and professors in the form of a power point presentation at the end of six weeks.  This was also important to me, because I was able to build up my resume for
something I am passionate about, and got to network with different people in the engineering realm, to refer to in future pursuits.
","I struggled with something a year ago, when my friends and I were on a robotics team for the first time.  We all go to a College Readiness program known as HEAF or the Harlem Educational Activities Fund, and partnered with NYU to compete in the First Tech Challenge Robotics Competition.  Learning how to design and build a robot from scratch caught all of us off guard, and we often bumped heads on ideas on how we could be more creative than the rest.  Although, we were hit with an early reality check at our first qualifier event, where our robot barely moved, and failed to meet basic requirements.  Never letting failure consume me, I accepted this challenge, and made sure to stay engaged and lift up my teammates as well; whether talking to them individually or agreeing to stay later in order to help finish the workload.  While in middle school it was stressed to have a growth mindset.  This meant first acknowledging a problem, accepting it, and finally overcoming it.  Success takes hard work, and evidently my team and I would go on to dominate our next few tournaments, and win two motivational award trophies for our efforts.  This struggle did not define us, instead it humbled us, and made us realize a new approach and focus was needed.
","I always prefer to work in a team, because I have flaws and like hearing different perspectives from like-minded individuals.  Also, I am a social being and grateful to say networking has brought me around many mentors that have contributed to how far I’ve gotten today.  Like the quote states there is “Strength in numbers”.  I especially feel that it’s my duty to not only empower myself through teamwork; but, also contribute as much as possible to meet our goals.  Isolation doesn’t advance a people, and I feel it’s ignorant in a way for someone to feel they can’t gain from others.  Lastly, I feel working in a team, is not necessarily subject to just your peers, but could include elders who have already finished the book, while another is still analyzing the book’s cover.  Wisdom, experience, and even the intelligence and youth of young minds complementing each other, I believe are truly fundamental in getting results.  Even if one person is credited with the creation of a company, it’s always a strong team that keeps a company going.  All the greats, such as Steve Jobs and Bill Gates all had a great foundation with them; I plan on, and cherish doing the same.",6,Yes,ayeustache@gmail.com,238845445,ayeustache@gmail.com,Ayinde E.

My very first experience with coding was during a science summer camp I attended in the fourth grade. The camp focused on computer and physical science through the creation of video games.  I was stunned by how I could bring something to life through a game?  The course used a program that substituted java script with command blocks. I felt proud pouring so much work into the game I created. The act of creating something meant so much to me at that time because I never thought I could do what I saw on Xbox and other places.  This coupled with my love of video games in general stoked the flames of innovation within me. I hope through the All Star Code Summer Intensive to again learn how to create things online but with a more thorough knowledge of coding. This program offers the capability to stoke the flames that have been burning within me for years.,"The most exciting thing about technology to me is its infinite number of applications. For everything that can be done, some piece of technology can be created to help us do that activity even better. One of my favorite things to study is the life sciences. This includes chemistry and biology. I have always found the study of life and natural forces to be very intriguing. I believe that when we take the knowledge we have about our natural surroundings and couple it with the advancements in technology that have been made, there is an unlimited amount of potential. Some of the most computer science applications I read include those for neuroscience, stem cell biology, and even fit technology. ","If money were no object, then I would choose to go to either Johns Hopkins University of Emory University. Both of these are located on the East Coast and are fairly close to home. The main thing that interest me about both of these, is there amazing science programs. Both schools have been known to produce geniuses in medical fields. Even though I am not particularly interested in becoming a practitioner of medicine, the information about biology and chemistry I can acquire will be invaluable in whatever field I chose to have a profession in. For one to become a incredible biologist or chemist, he must have a very good work ethic and be extremely passionate about what he is doing. While I do have a strong passion for both of these topics, A grades do not come easy to me. I work really hard to get good grades. I have open dialogues with my teachers about my work and how they think I can improve.","Last summer, I had an internship at an online start up company. The name of the company is Jet.com. They are a regional competitor to amazon that also offers grocery deliveries. I was bought in as a merchandise organizer. The job required that I organized the merchandise from manufacturers and upload their information onto the site. This was my first paid job outside child care and I was expected to come in for a certain amount of time everyday to work. The first thing that I had to do was identify the category the product would belong in. I had to learn the specific groupings that Jet.com used on their site. This took some time. A few of the first nights, I had to sit down when I got home and memorize the categories Jet.com had set up. I had to dedicate extra time outside of the work space to make my time more efficient. Because of this, the next few weeks was much easier. This job served as the first time that I had to effectively work hard for the sake of other people and larger tasks that came after my contribution. I really felt that the work I was doing would ultimately help the company. This belief was reassured in the constant reminder I got from my co-workers. I felt that a responsibility had been given to me, and for the sake of the company, I could not let them down.","The first time I ever truly struggled in school was during the semester I took Advanced Economics. I really lobbied hard with my parents and the school to take this class.  This was the first advanced course I had ever taken and I thought it would look good on my college applications. I expected the class to be relatively challenging so my intention was to meet with the teacher a few extra times in the week to make sure that I understood the material. However, this was a completely new type of difficult. I had never taken a class this difficult and it was embarrassing to admit this to my teachers and parents. Other times, if for some reason I was doing bad in a class, it was because I was not putting in 100% effort, never a lack of comprehension. The first test of the class was unbelievable. Everything I thought I knew was quickly thrown out of the window. I received a 64% and was devastated. I thought it was because it was the first test and my nerves had gotten the better of me. But the material continued to challenge me.  The test served as a wake up call. I proceeded to create a plan for what I would do to raise my grade in the class. I worked tirelessly with the instructor and my advisers to make sure I raised my grade.  Whatever happens, I know that I have given the class 100% effort and because of that, any grade I ultimately receive, I will be proud of it.","I prefer to work in groups. But within groups, it is essential that every member knows what they are responsible for and can be held accountable if the standards are not met. I firmly believe that the collective knowledge of a group will always be greater than the individual. Also, the problem solving ability of individuals increases greatly when people are able to work together and compete to find the best answer the quickest.

I want to get as much hands on practice as possible with using coding to solve simulated or real problems. Actively coding is a very fun, stimulating pursuit that the All Star Code Summer Intensive will allow me to complete all summer long. I will not only be able to build on and hone my computer science skills with the intensive training, but also to maximize the benefits of the rare opportunity to receive otherwise unavailable mentorship in and exposure to the tech industry. I really wish to immerse myself in the environment of technology professionals, helpful mentors, and like-minded achievers that the program generates.  The summer intensive will help me develop both my technological skills and my people skills, and therefore I believe it will equip me with abilities essential to my goal of successfully going out into the tech industry so I can give back to my community. I am fascinated by all the intricacies of programming, so I hope to gain experience from the firsthand applications of concepts. I am seeking to seize this opportunity to make connections, begin networking, and truly begin to break into this field. If I am accepted there will be a lot to learn before I'm ready to majorly change anything, but I believe together we can change the world.","I am really excited about most technology in general, but especially the new and innovative. Learning how any technology works is thrilling, because I love breaking down complicated inventions, gadgets, and codes to figure out precise functions of parts and how they contribute to the whole. At the moment I have particular interest in robotics and mobile applications. Robotics allows code functionality to manifest itself in physical form, creating effective solutions to so many problems that humans could not solve as efficiently, or even at all. Robots allow us to to push the frontier of exploration further out, whether it be far out in the galaxy or deep down in our oceans. Mobile applications are so useful because they are easy to carry and have with you. As increasing numbers of people get mobile phones, apps continue to have a wider reach. Also, lately apps have become more and more versatile, with creative solutions to more and more daily life problems. Soon apps for things like disease detection,or crime scene investigation could reach the market. ","If money were no object, I would want to go study electrical engineering and computer science at MIT. I feel that this is the best way for me to help people through something I am passionate about. With both computer science and electrical engineering I could work to develop software and gadgets that benefit everyone in some way. I would also want to study physics, my favorite science course, because it helps in understanding the natural world around me. However, an obstacle to this would be lack of access to many extracurricular activities that I'd need to get there. After this, the only obstacle left would be myself. I'd have to make sure to work hard and pursue this goal constantly, striving to make the world a better place.","I visited family in my home city in Guinea, West Africa for the summer. I went to various places where relatives resided and stayed with them to catch up on their lives and just spend time with them. This was a very important trip to me because it took me back to my roots, an experience which everyone should go through every once in a while. It is important to always remember where you come from, and keep in touch with family. Traveling there over the summer helped to strengthen my familial bonds, until the next trip back. This voyage was especially significant because it was the last time I'd ever see my grandmother. We should all ensure that time is spent with family before it is too late. My vacation in my hometown grounded me, and reminded me of the reason I want to be successful going into the tech industry: so as to be able to help the lives of those like my family in countries with an infrastructure not as strong as America's or any European country's. ","While working on a Library Management System Project in my AP Computer Science course, the java.io Input/Output package was required, however it was never discussed in class. In the beginning, I struggled a lot with figuring out how to read and write to files in java. This was a challenging task because it was a new concept in coding that I had to teach myself. However, after extensive Google searches, and also getting help from my teacher, I was able to understand many of the components of java input output. It took hard work along with a few good Google search skills to overcome this hurdle, but the experience taught me that in programming I will be able to use existing resources to build and get the knowledge I need to create the things I need.","I think adaptability is very important in life situations, and therefore I believe that both are important. I think I am able to work in both environments, either by myself or with other people. When working alone, I am required to work hard to finish, and with other people I can learn new ideas from different designs.",5,Yes,diallob1@bxscience.edu,242440203,diallob1@bxscience.edu,,Boubocar Diallo,,,0,Boubacar Diallodfc,Google,3,7,7,Dispute,"HTML, CSS, JS, front and back-end",Tell your story,"Software engineer, coding teacher",Would be great TF,Speaking,Tech,Tech,1

As said in my research, the All Star Code Program is a non-profit initiative made specifically to prepare young men of color for full-time employment in the technology industry. Therefore, my cultural background alone, along with my interest in technology already makes me extremely interested in this program because I suit what the program looks for. Also in my research I learned that the program prepares these young men of color by providing mentorship, exposure to the industry, and through training in computer science. All of these factors can be very beneficial on my behalf.  Not only would they be providing me with key skills and information needed in the field of technology but they would also be giving me an advantage over others looking to enter employment in this field.
","What really excites me about technology is how complex it is. For example things such as a cell phone. Something so small and so simple looking can do a countless number of things. That truly amazes me. A particular area in technology that I am interested in is computer science because I enjoy using computers and I would like to expand my knowledge of computers and how they work. However, I am open to other areas of technology as well.
","If money were no object, I would go to college at the University of Pennsylvania and study under the field of computer engineering or maybe some other type of engineering. This is because the University of Pennsylvania has one of the top engineering programs in the country. Also because it is an Ivy League school and these schools are generally known as great schools. Their high reputations would serve well when applying for a job in the future. When different jobs look at your resume and see that you studied under one of the Ivy League school’s programs, they are going to look at you more favorably than someone who studied under a program from any other school. However an obstacle that may prevent me from achieving this is the low acceptance rate due to the large number of applicants. This really low acceptance rate their makes it hard for not only me, but for anyone to get accepted.
","Last summer I did a lot of things that were important to me. One of these things was that I went to basketball camp. Basketball is my favorite sport and I have actually been a member of the varsity team at my school since I was a freshman. The camp was important to me because it allowed me to learn new skills and techniques to ultimately become a better basketball player. Another thing I did was go on a cruise with my family. Cruises are my favorite type of vacations because you get to visit different islands all while having access to tons of fun activities on the boat. This was important to me because it served as a well needed break from all my activities. One last thing that I did last summer that was important to me was visit colleges. Visiting colleges is very important because it gives you a first hand experience of what the campus is like; something you can’t see or feel on paper.
"," A thing that I struggled with was art. Since middle school, I was required to take an art class in my school. From the start I hated art. I didn’t enjoy drawing and I was no good at it. Despite this I continued to try my best. After a couple years of taking art classes I began to improve and a love for art began to come upon me. Each drawing progressively became better and better and now I am an excellent drawer. The hardest part of this struggle was staying committed to art because I did not enjoy it. However in the long run it paid off and led to me becoming a fantastic artist.","I prefer working as part of a team because I feel it can be more beneficial than working alone. When you are working in a team, you not only accomplish things faster, but you can also bounce ideas off of each other. By being able to do this I feel the overall project or what is being worked on would come out better. Also an extra set of eyes can’t hurt you. For example, say you wrote an essay and you proof read it over and over and noticed no flaws. But when someone else reads it over they’ll notice a silly error in a heartbeat.

Technology has completely changed the world we live in today. Technology has allowed us to discover so many things about the world that we live in. Technology has allowed us to find out where we come from. Technology is something that helps us redefine the future. I have two areas that I am interested in, one is computer engineering, and the other is computer science. These areas interest me, because I want to be the person that is behind the scenes, and creating all the cool products that people would soon love, and use everyday.","I would love to go to the University of Pennsylvania School of Engineering and Applied Science.

Also according to U.S. news education, University of Pennsylvania’s engineering ranking is 19, and to me that is just right. One obstacle that can prevent me from this dream is myself, because I truly believe in the quote, “The only thing that is stopping you is you.”","Last year I took a trip to a place that I can truly call home, and that is Trinidad & Tobago. In Trinidad, most of my family is there, and I always love going there, because I feel so much love. This time around the trip was different, because I was helping out the homeless in Trinidad. In Trinidad, my grandmother owns a church, and every year she runs a food and clothes drive for the homeless, and last year I was fortunate enough to participate in the distribution of the food. Usually I am the person that is sending some of the food from America to Trinidad, but last year I got to send it, and give it out to the people. This was important to me, because just seeing the homeless peoples face light up when I gave them their food just made my heart melt. That day I knew that I was making a difference in the world.","The last time I struggled with something was when I was trying to remember all the Spanish that I have learned over the semester for my final. The challenging part was just remembering every single Spanish word that I learned. I just remember I was struggling so much, and I even began to doubt myself. Then I remembered that I serve an awesome God, and he gets me through any tribulation that I am going through. So, to get through this troubling I just turned to God, and he was able to calm me down, and allowed me to get my A on my final.","I always prefer to be a part of a team.

I have always loved to create things because whatever you make is something you can call yours which reflects the work you put in to make it. Even from a young age, I would always make my own creations with Lego. Then I was able to implement that love into computers when I discovered coding.","What most excites me about technology is it's limitless applications; that anything is possible with advanced enough technology. I am particularly interested in Artificial Intelligence, Virtual Reality, and Human Enhancement. Artificial Intelligence for personal assistance as well as further work on solutions to problems humans have already tackled and failed, such as terminal illnesses. Virtual reality as I imagine it to be in the future is a device that can send and receive electrical signals from the brain in order to create a world we would perceive as real while our actual bodies would be in a sleep-like state. This can have many applications my personal favorites being video games taken to the next level, and research simulations. We already have computer simulations that mimic the real world for testing, by adding that to Virtual Reality, we can create a world made for research with zero risk of death or injury. Human Enhancement such as ""smart blood"", nanobots in our blood to clot faster, clear veins and arteries and act as an extra immune system, or connecting ourselves to the internet, or another mass collection of information and communication yet to be created. All these as possible with technology and I hope to play a part in making them a reality.","I would go to Massachusetts Institute of Technology because it leads the world in technological developments. I would study Computer Science and Electrical Engineering because those two field are of great interest to me and I would like to make a career out of them somewhere like Space X or NASA, or anywhere I can make the aforementioned technological ideas a reality. Obstacles in achieving this dream would be Admission and Tuition. I've heard the admission to MIT is very hard to obtain, however I do believe I am qualified due to my grades, school difficulty, and extracurricular activities like track, archery, and martial arts. Tuition however if a different story since I don't know what the price will be in 3 years, but I'll hope for the best.","Last summer I took a trip to El Salvador. It was important to me because it was the first time in two years I got to see the rest of my family in person. While there, my family and I went to a beach resort called DeCameron, we danced ate food and partied. Then we went to different volcanoes such as El Cero Verde and El Boqueron, it was very interesting to see the volcanic rocks and gaze into the massive crater. Finally, we took a tour to Guatemala, where I got to interact with indigenous Guatemalan villagers. It was 3 weeks I spent in El Salvador with my family, then it was time to return to the states.  ","Something I recently struggled with was my flash programming final. I had to create a game using everything we had learned during the semester. I made a game where you control a spaceship and have to dodge asteroids. What was challenging about it was getting the textbox to display the right health points without just writing it on top of the previous, now incorrect, number. The way I over came this was my asking for help from the upper classmen since they were more experienced than I. They said to try to create a textbox on the stage instead of creating it dynamically and then updating the value every frame. With this help I was able to change my approach to the situation and make my game work the way that I wanted it to and I received a perfect 100 for it. ","I prefer to work as part of a team. This is because with more people working on the same problem, they can provide new ideas and perspective to find a solution, just like with my flash programming final. Thus, a solution is found faster and there is less work load for the team member.

All Star Code Summer Intensive demonstrates a strong passion in teaching boys the necessary skills needed for fields in technology and engineering. Honestly, I have a strong passion for Computer Science; it's something I'm most certainly sure that I want to pursue in college. I have coded java script before, but I want to better my skills as a coder, even if it means spending multiple hours practicing. I also know that through the assistance of the All Star Code Staff, I can achieve my goal of pursuing a career in Computer Science. In addition, I want to take advantage of the opportunities the Summer Intensive offers, such as career exposure to companies that specialize in technology. Being given this opportunity to start exploring different fields in technology is exciting and reassuring that I can succeed in the pursuing Computer Science. Ultimately, the All Star Code Summer Intensive program can help me in career development and lead me on the right path.
","The main thing that interests me about technology is computers. Everything about them has fascinated me since I was 12. I always wanted to know what made them work and how they functioned. Personally, what mostly excites me about technology is that it is always changing. Something new is always coming out every month or year and is something no one has thought of. The sense of originality that technology allows people to present is very interesting.  Particularly, I am interested in Computer Science because it's the process that allows a computer to run programs and perform basic tasks. From Computer Science, I would hope to follow a career in programming or something related to game development. I find it interesting how software programmers can make very lively games with just a few string of code and hope for one day to do the same.  Personally, I find it very difficult to pick just one aspect of technology that excites me because in this new generation, technology is rapidly improving and I want to be a part of this. I find it exciting how people can take technology and do extraordinary things, things that people wouldn’t think of doing. Most importantly; technology offers limitless opportunities for creative people.
","A college I would strive to attend would be Dartmouth. They have a very strong program in Computer Science, and feel I would benefit greatly by attending the college. This college in my eyes, is my dream college because I absolutely love Computer Science. I started coding HTML my freshman year in high school and found it fascinating what I could do. With simple strings of code, I was able to create a functioning website. Although most of my work came from Code Academy, I feel this motivated me to pursue Computer Science in college. However, being someone who is average at school, this would be my greatest obstacle. As there are people who probably have stronger academic performances than myself, this would make the process much more difficult. However, as of right now, I am trying my hardest in increasing my grades, as I still have time to improve myself. I like to think of this obstacle as my motivation to do better in school and have a higher chance of attending my dream college.
","Last summer, I attended the Opportunity Network Summer Institute. It familiarizes us with students we would be seeing weekly after summer. In addition, it assisted in preparing us for real world connections with professionals. From this, I learned how to write a proper email, dress professionally, keep in contact with professionals and so much more. However, this slightly touches upon why this was a very important opportunity to me. Being introduced to professional etiquette was significant because these were skills that I could use in any environment I am put in. Thus, being a valuable asset for future reference.  I also had the opportunity to meet the most passionate students who I now consider my friends. Honestly, in school no one seems to be very passionate about doing school work, but here were more than 100 students who always wanted to do better like myself. Through the Opportunity Network Summer Institute, I learned how to make myself a better student. From basic study habits to learning how to relax every now and then, this offered me much more than just professional etiquette. It helped me become a better student and person.
","Sweaty, blinking constantly and stuttering - this is what describes my experience with public speaking. I was mess when I had to talk to a large group of people. However, during my sophomore year, I decided it was time to confront this fear of public speaking. I signed up as a Master of Ceremonies for my school's Latin American Carnival. It promoted Spanish culture and traditions through a night of different styles of dance and performances. I would have to introduce each dance and segment between the dances in front of a large crowd of 50-80 people. Personally, this was terrifying as I struggled talking in front of classmates, but I couldn’t let that keep me from dealing with my fear. I practiced with committee members 3 times a week for 2 hours. I had written flashcards to read from, and pushed myself to try to memorize all of it without stuttering. I also had the support of my family who helped me rehearse every day after school. They understood that this was very important to me as it would me get over an obstacle. As the date of the Carnival approached, I became very nervous, but I knew I had been constantly preparing and that I was 100% ready for it. The day of Carnival was a success as the people at the carnival supported me. I let out a few jokes that entertained the crowd, just hearing their laughs made me much more secure about presenting on stage. Ultimately, this experience forced me to get out of my comfort zone and deal with this fear of mine.","Preferably, I would rather work as part of a team than alone. This is because I feel like there are more opportunities to hear different types of ideas in a group. You have multiple perspectives about a certain topic and it can diversify the group's ideas. Also, it allows for someone to always have support from the group. I have the understanding that nothing is done alone, everything someone has done has been through the help from a team. A team helps each other grow and succeed together, not individually. Additionally, I feel like I could learn from others and this is probably the best thing you can get from a team. The opportunity to learn from someone else who can teach you something you didn’t know. If I’m stuck on something and just can’t seem to figure it out, I have a group of people who are willing to help me. Finally, I would rather work in a team than alone because there are better opportunities to grow, not just individually but as a team.

Yes, I did have a group of friends and I did do cool things outside of school but I never really felt connected with them entirely. That isn’t until I went to my first hackathon, YaleHacks, with my friend Mamadou and his rag-tag group of friends. Uninvited, we simply stood where we heard the bus would pick up NYC students, got on, and went to Yale University for a night of cool intro workshops, funny  jokes, free food, and code that failed. Mamadou had invited his other ASC friends and so when I finally asked them, what got them interested in technology, they all went on to describe ASC. They spoke highly about the program and how it was their moment of learning to embrace failure and meet people from the same background, yet different in passions, that share similar goals. This was an important moment for me because it sounded like an important opportunity to find my niche, while learning about coding, and grow more as an individual.","There are numerous things that interests me about technology, however, what really excites me is not so much technical as it is impactful. If you were to tell someone from my native area of Guerrero, Mexico that there’s an infinite amount of  resources to learn from available to them on one single machine, a laptop, they’ll doubt you and give you nothing more than a strange look. This concept of such large amounts of information being in such small machines is completely alien to them. If they were taught how to use a laptop and access the internet to use free resources like Khan Academy, Youtube, and other websites dedicated to learning, they would be looking at a much more intellectual, maybe even more prosperous, future. Technology has the capability to use information to make the entire world a great equalizer. Now, this isn’t to say it’ll automatically solve the world's biggest problems in education, but I do believe that a simple laptop with access to the internet (high-speed internet preferably), has the capabilities to take a step in the right direction to solving these problems.","If money were no object I’d probably apply to Columbia for biomedical engineering. I want to assist in the process of researching new ways to solve problems that prevent people from less fortunate backgrounds achieve and obtain the basics that most of us take for granted. This includes health insurance, free or not. The obstacles preventing me from achieving this goal is simply my academics at school. While I do have good grades, my school doesn't foster an environment where college success is the norm. However, I do not plan to let this stop me from getting into Columbia University, even if it means I have to search out every outside opportunity there is on the internet. ","Last summer I signed up for my school’s summer school curriculum. It was very important because I was exposed to a different side of my teachers that wouldn’t normally be seen in the normal day-to-day hiatus, each day carried this certain flow that entrailed this sense of peace that made the whole process of school seem a lot more organic-it was no longer forced. This made me have a moment of clarity, where I learned that teachers aren’t very different from us, that they have been in similar situations as we are, and that they can be beneficiary to our growth","I’m currently working on developing a peer to peer mentorship program for my school in order to connect alumni from different grades with one another in an effort to not only build a sense of community but to also make sure the incoming  generations of freshmen, and sophomores realize what they’re capable of. But long before I even started working on this, it was merely an idea that I didn’t see myself being able to perform, but as time went on I met several people that made me realize that the best way to make something happen is by simple initiative.","I prefer working in a team because I always get this sense of having to abide by a self-set conduct of moral obligations, which to me means that in order to succeed as group, as a team, there has to this level of understanding between one another-which I believe to be almost essential in order to prevail. And then there’s also the simple fact that if you’re surrounded by a group of peers, individuals, that the way you see something differs from the way they see something, that we all have different perspectives and different things to offer in regards to more than just the task at hand.",6,Yes,carlosloera.00@gmail.com,245123654,carlosloera.00@gmail.com,,Carlos Loera ,,,1,Carlos Loera,Alley,5,8,N/A,Beats by ASC,"HTML, CSS, JS, sound manipulation",Lateness,Tech.

The program has a good reputation in providing young men of color mentor ship and exposure in the tech industry.  I would value the opportunity to participate in summer program to keep abreast of the cutting edge technologies in the industry and to advance my career in the computer science.
","What really excites me about technology is its innovativeness. For example, I have a Xbox One, the technology that makes the machine work is amazing.   It makes you really think can I make a device like?  Can I deconstruct the mechanical and electrical on this device? How does it read my disc with technology? Every single aspect excites me about how does it works and how can I make this device better.  I am particularly interest in robotics which  is the branch of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and computer science that deals with the design, construction, operation, and application of robots as well as computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing.
","If money were no object, I would go to Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).  I would study computer science and electrical engineering. Computer Science is a subject that interest me because it is a course that studies the principles, design, and engineering of computer systems, both software and hardware.  I am also very interested in software design because it is used for the programs on the computer that really make the computer more engaging to use. The main obstacle is the affordability and money for college.  However, I am working very hard to achieve good grades to obtain a scholarship or grant to attend college. I am also looking for opportunities like the All Star Code Summer Intensive Program to further advance my growth and development in computer science.
","Last summer, I had my first job at Dstillery, a tech company in Manhattan.  Dstillery is  an advertising technology company which enables marketers to target prospects through scientific methods. I was assigned a task to clean their data up by different large companies that had moved or changed locations. Another task involved us to check who was running for President this year from the Democrats and The Republicans and where will they be holding their debates. This job was important to me because it was my first job in the tech industry. It was an amazing experience. I got to work with very experienced engineers, data scientists and media professionals.. It gave me an insider perspective on what these jobs entails, the responsibilities for tasks and the responsibilities of reporting to my supervisor in a work environment.

","I struggled with my mechatronics  project last year with making a smart belt, Mechatronics is a blend of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer control and information technology.This was a very challenging for me and my partner Amisha Rana.  It was challenging because we took a long time brainstorming to come up with ideas, use for the product, persons who would use it and then to take the idea from the concept to a prototype .When we finished brainstorming we decide to make a smart belt.  The idea behind the smart belt is that the smart belt would be used for people that have disability with vision and hearing. The target consumer for the product would be persons with disability and older consumers. This device we used called a 1sheeld  helped us develop these ideas in order to have compatibility with your smartphone.
","I prefer to work as a  part of a  team.  I enjoy working as a part of a team, not only to learn from my team members but to share my ideas on the shared goal of the group. I work very well in groups taking my assigned task or responsibility seriously to make sure the group works achieves its goals. Also working as a part of a team means you can get more achieved efficiently working from the individual strengths of each team member. If given an assignment I can work independently.

I am deeply passionate about math and science and I plan to major in computer science in college. My goal is to start a completely automated hedge fund by building a comprehensive algorithmic stock trading system to generate returns before I graduate from high school. I have been trying to get started by reading books and watching YouTube videos about how to write and successfully implement stock trading algorithms, but I feel uncomfortable, unsure and not very confident in my computer science proficiency. I have figured out all of the logistics, but the code needs to still be written. I need help and most importantly guidance and mentors to help me get started in this ever-changing technological world to help me to not only succeed, but to lead and innovate.
","There are many things that excite me about technology. What feels best is the lack of boundaries and how vast the possibilities seem to be. I believe nothing can stop me and there is nothing that I cannot do or achieve. The fields in which I am most interested are quantitative finance, robotics, and biotechnology. I have purchased books on quantitative finance and want to learn as much as I can about the topic. I want to be an innovator in the field of quantitative finance, and I hope to bring more diversity and community outreach to Wall Street.","If money were no object, I would want to attend Stanford University in California and major in computer science. After graduating, I would get a Masters degree and a PhD in quantitative finance. I love California and warmer weather and had a chance to visit last year when my family dropped off my older sister, a Gates Millennium Scholar, at UCLA. Regardless of what I do, I know that I will always be interested in technology and computer science. One possible obstacle that might stop me is homesickness. Family is extremely important to me and I live in New Jersey, which would mean I would be going to college across the country. In addition, I would want to play lacrosse (another big passion of mine) in college, but unfortunately the popularity of lacrosse hasn’t completely reached the West coast. ","I spent most of last summer taking Algebra II Honors and playing lacrosse with an elite team at competitive tournaments. I absolutely love math and want to be as strong as I can in the subject. I am now one of a few sophomores taking pre-calculus in a classroom of seniors and doing very well. This was challenging at first, but through helping others and seeking help myself, I was able to go above and beyond. Playing competitive lacrosse is extremely important to me.  As a vital member of my team, I am building my leadership and team building skills and learning the importance of greater accountability and developing relationships. Last summer was very productive, but I am really hoping this upcoming summer will be full of amazing experiences.
","I am no stranger to struggle. When I was playing ice hockey in 7th grade I sustained a very significant injury to both of my hips. The condition, called a Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis (SCFE) required that I have surgery for doctors to insert metal screw in each of my hips to connect my femur to my growth plate. Doctors told me that I would never be completely healed and that I could not play sports. This was a very emotional time for me, but I refused to let this keep me down. I worked hard and exercised and it paid off in the end. Even when I was on crutches for many weeks, I had my mother drop me off at the local Y so I could exercise my upper body. Over time, my efforts continued to make a difference. Not only did I make a full recovery, but also I was in better shape physically and mentally. I returned to sports, not years later, but by the next season. This was a very large obstacle that I faced, but I overcame and prevailed. ","I firmly believe that you have to be able to work as a part of a team if you want to be an integral part of success. The more minds that work on a task, the more efficiently it can get done and the more accurate the results. Over the years I have built leadership skills as vice president of the teen group in my Jack and Jill Greater Essex County chapter, during many years of sports and in academic environments during group work. Everybody in my family is a natural born leader. My mother is the national president of a non-profit for mothers of color called Mocha Moms, Inc. that organizes big conferences and meetings all around the country. My dad is a small business owner and worked hard for many years as a councilman on our local town council. Together, they taught me the importance of hard work and working with others.

I have always taken the interest into technology because the futuristic aspect of it is what intrigues me. Sci-fi has always been one of my favorite type of genres ever since I was a child, gaming and computers is what reached out to me at early age, and now that I have the opportunity to study the field I wish to find a career in the market. Not only does computer hardware show eye candy but the software side of computer hacking is what puts my eye on the ball.","Hacking has always remained a mystery to me ever since I discovered the term from my early age of playing video games. Cyber defense is what reframes me from a vigilante or a villain. The reason this field pertains to me so much is because I wish to not be vulnerable in the cyber world. The education would renew my whole outlook on security and as well polish my developing skills of this field. Another particular area I have newly developed interest for would be cloud engineering, as of now I do not completely know how the cloud works but I aim myself to achieve this knowledge.","If money were no object then the college I aim myself to be in would be MIT just because of the campus itself. The field of study would still remain the same but I would slightly see myself taking interest into architecture. Why I say that is because engineering is not just my sole interest, I as well take special interest into art, a field that I have practiced since I was little. To be straight forward money and the enjoyment of my career is what I desire to obtain.","Before the beginning of last summer I was overweight, my doctor had told me several times that I was in need of reduction to my weight in order to maintain my good health. So what did during last summer was very important to me. Instead of laughing away the limited time of my break, I put myself into a position of self motivation and self determination. Besides my newly obtained physical state and health benefits, I achieved willpower, a determination that led me with confidence. Another goal that I accomplished would be the computer I am using now to type this application, during the summer I plunged myself into the study of computer hardware because of the interest of pc gaming, Photoshop, fruity loops and other pc apps. The knowledge that I obtained during my study is what enabled me to construct my pc piece by piece with self labor.","Before this year I had always struggled with my weight, my motivation, my confidence, and my grades. Altogether I felt doomed until I revaluated my whole life situation. Instead of falling under the signs of self pity, I engaged myself into self-discipline. Though my coming of age is what brought myself into the light, my loved ones are the ones that contributed.

The influence, impact, and convenience of technology really fascinate me because of how it has made tasks-that were once difficult- very easy and simple to do, and allowed our society to develop and become more connected. The abilities, and convenience of technology are what really excite me, and have made me deeply interested in exploring more about it.
I am interested in programming, cyber security, robotics, and networking and communications. These are areas of technology that are very interesting to work with, in great demand, and will continue to expand and advance in the future.","I would go to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and study Computer Science because I am greatly interested in that field, and I would like to have a career in that field. However, I might have to live on campus because it is far away from where I live, so I might have to live and continue my studies in an environment where I will not always have my family close to me, and will have to use technology to regularly communicate with them. The obstacle of distance might prevent me from achieving my dream because my parents could feel unsure about permitting me to go live, and study in Massachusetts by myself, and might suggest moving to a closer university within New York. I still hope that my parents will see how mature and responsible I am, change their minds, and allow me to achieve my dream.  ","Last summer, I went to Ecuador with my father for three weeks to visit our family, and relax, as we traveled around the country, and visited some amazing places. We went hiking in the mountains, explored the dense Amazon jungle, and relaxed on the beach after our two-week adventure was over. On our trip, we were able to witness the hidden beauty, and marvelous sights our country had to offer; we also had a chance to greet our family, catch up on important events, and spend time with each other. My trip to Ecuador was a memorable, life-changing experience because I realized how beautiful, and valuable nature is, and how it is appreciated by the people who depend on it for survival. As people who reside in an urban environment, we may not value nature as much, and may not be aware of its importance because of our limited contact with nature. However, based on my experience, people who live in direct contact with nature do their best to conserve it for their own survival, and avoid harming nature as much as possible. My experience showed me that there are still people who need nature, and that we must continue to work together to conserve the environment by being cautious, and conscious about the effect we have on the environment. I believe that new technologies in the future will also help us conserve the environment, and possibly even  reverse the damage it has sustained. Hence, my trip to Ecuador was important to me because it was a very eye-opening experience.        ","This year, I struggled with a challenging and rigorous Physics project that involved constructing a car model out of CDs, straws, skewers, rubber bands, tape, and cardboard. I worked with a partner, and we had a design in mind for the model, but it was complex, and required lots of materials. After, acquiring extra materials and creating our final draft of the model, we began constructing our model, with a built-in suspension system that kept the body of our car from sinking in, and prevented it from falling apart. However, our model took a week to complete, and we had to stay after regular school hours to make sure it was near perfect. Once it was finished, we tested our model on a ramp that our teacher set up, and it went completely straight down the ramp at a nice speed. Our model was a success, even though the construction process was very extensive and difficult because of the extra features we added to it, and its large size. We received an A on our project, and our teacher gave us a shoutout for adding a suspension system that no one else used in their models. The project was challenging, but it taught me a valuable lesson that giving up is never right, especially on your goals and dreams, and with my partner, we were still able to get an A for our hard work and determination.  ","I prefer working as part of a team because it allows me to interact with other people, exchange ideas with them, and complete a task quickly, and more efficiently. Working on a team also allows me to contribute much more, and encourages me to take more action towards completing a task or project. On a team, I could also learn much more from other people that are also contributing to the task, and share my contributions as well.",6,Yes,daniela9525@bla2hs.org,237579474,daniela9525@bla2hs.org,"Daniel Astudillo ,Daniel Astudillo ",Daniel Astudillo ,,,0,Daniel Astudillo,Google,5,8,N/A,Travel Buddy (Artificial World),"Raspberry Pi, physical computing, unix, HTML, CSS, JS, APIs, python",Quiet,Create A.I. or robot,,Quiet,Tech,Tech,1

Even though technology has it's downfalls it's positive effects outweighs them. For example I am highly interested in Apple's new product that they are going to release this spring. Technology also paves the way for new innovations or, products that can benefit people in various ways whether it be in everyday home life, exercise, business, education, and plenty of other categories.","If money weren't a factor, the college I would like to attend would be Howard University. I chose this college because, this college is a HBCU, and I also have family ties to this college. My father attended this collage along with my aunt, who graduated law school at Howard University. If I were to attend Howard University I would like to study some sort of engineering. I have knowledge that there are many fields in engineering, although so far I have been considering the civil, and nuclear field of engineering.","Last summer I helped my dad build one of his rental properties, and this job was very important to me because, not only did I get to bond with my father but, also this job taught me to values team work, and hard work.

My dad, brother, uncles and I all participated in building this house.

I struggle with this class because like many other kids now a day I dislike reading, especially if the text doesn't consist of a topic I am interested in. Although I dislike reading know this is a key to having a successful, and educated career so I have been improving on this subject by reading more to increase my vocabulary, and comprehension.","I prefer working as part of a team because, when working with teammates you have many more ideas that could lead to many more or better solutions. When you are working, teammates are involved it makes the activity much easier, and less stressful. Teammates can also help you if you don't understand directions or the activity so you should never be off topic. Lastly I think it is good to work as part of a team because, most jobs now a day require you to work in an environment that consist of other people. You also may not know these people, that's why it is important for you to know how to work well or get along with all people.",5,Yes,dannonthomas@ymail.com,242245623,dannonthomas@ymail.com,,Dannon Thomas,,,1,Dannon Thomas,Google,N/A,4,N/A,AlcSafe,N/A,"Debugging, Googling",,,Research,,,0

I feel that this program will be able to teach me the necessary skills and provide me with the tools to accomplish my goal; not to mention the valuable exposure to top tech companies so that I may expand my network.","What excites me about technology is that it is constantly improving and never stays stagnant. I have come to realize that technology is like a me in the fact that both I and technology choose to improve and never stay in one place. Technology is also a place of escape from the real world as it provides a hobby and virtual world to me.

I would major in computer science and minor in business. I would do this because I am interested in computer science as well as  interested in technology and thus it would be my major. I would minor in business so that I may have the basic knowledge and would be capable of establishing my own tech company. Obstacles that would prevent me from achieving this dream is the lack of resources in my area that provide courses on computer science and other technology based areas. Another obstacle that might prevent me form achieving this dream is the acceptance rate of Notre Dame and the rarity of students from my area going to prestigious colleges or universities.  ","Last summer I was able to participate in a Internship at Hearst Corporation. During this internship I learned valuable skills that would allow me to succeed in the business aspect of my career. I was able to meet people from various careers and be able to have a meeting as well as learn of their life story. This internship was important to me as I was able to improve my network as well as get exposure to the different career choices. It was a very valuable experience that I definitely took advantage. I will cherish all of the skills I learned and people I met, as it helped me on my  career path.","A time in which I struggled with something was this year. I was struggling in my a.p. chemistry class. I ended up with a score of a 65% on my report card for the first marking period. It was an all time low for me as I have always been an honor student. It was the first time I had not received  Honors on my report card. It was a difficult time as I was even contemplating on dropping the class in all. I was going to drop out but I decided to speak with my teacher about it. He told me that when things get hard we quit in a sarcastic voice. He may of said it playfully but those words sparked a fire in me. I was determined to remain in the class and give it another chance. I studied harder and went to my teacher after school and asked for help. I ended the marking period with a twelve percent increase in my score, it now stood at a 77%. I am still not proud of the score but it is an improvement and that is what I am proud of. I was able to keep going even when I was at my lowest. I was able to find ways to improve my score and solve my problem.","I honestly prefer to work as a team. Although at times I find it easier to work solo, working as a team allows me to improve my abilities. I can improve my abilities by working as a team because I can take bits of other people's ideas to improve mine and the members of my team can also do the same onto me. As a team one is able to accomplish more in a shorter period of time, and the works quality is not affected negatively because of this, but instead in a positive way. I  have always like teams as I have always played team sports for as long as I can remember. It is amazing how everyone has to account for their own work and their level of production is heightened as they are no longer working for themselves but for the members of the team as well. This brings a level of alertness that working alone can not provide.

I've always been interested in code and programming, so he brought up this program to me. I guess I missed out last year. Besides the programming and code aspect of the program, I'm interested in meeting successful people in the technology world and having the opportunity to travel to different tech companies. I'm also interested in creating bonds with people who love the same thing as me. I'm also glad that most of them are people of color. You don't really see that, and most of my friends who love programming, are kids who grew up in that environment. To sum it up, I'm just really excited to learn more about code, and make some new friends that are just like me.","What really excites me about technology is how it's constantly expanding. Every minute, of every hour, of every day, technology is reaching and breaking new heights. I want to be a software designer because with every new piece of technology, code and software are behind it. There would be no technology without code and software. The 3D printer doesn't just know  how to build this and that. It has code built in to it to make  it understand. The Xbox One can't update without the necessary software. That's what I'm going to do. Hopefully, I'll have my own company built around advancing technology and gaming.","When I was about 11-12 years old, I got an acceptance letter from this video game design college called Full Sail University. Unfortunately, I denied. I felt I was too young, and wasn't prepared for a college life so soon. To this day though, I don't know how the school got my information. Anyways, if money wasn't an object, I would go to Full Sail University. The school has a great campus which offers a lot of programs that will increase my knowledge on Software Designing and Video game designing. If I go into the course called Software Development and finish the course, I could get my Bachelors of Science degree. I could be the next Software Designer for gaming companies like Valve, Nexon, Treyarch. So many opportunities from that one school. Nothing really preventing e from that dream. Not yet at least.","Last summer, I stayed in New Hampshire with my second family. They are not family by blood or adoption but from this summer program called The Fresh Air Fund. With this program kids all over New York City, are given the great opportunity to get out of the city and head out to different suburban areas of New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts. The family that I currently stay with (The Curraos), have been my second family for over 5 years. We grew really close and they truly do feel like family. The family consists of three brothers and a newly added sister (who really isn't a sister but a cousin I believe). Me and the guys love going swimming, hiking, biking, skateboarding, and playing video games. We also have ultimate Nerf Wars, which are just crazy. They are so important to me because they got rid of my fear of swimming. Thanks to them, I am now doing water polo, and taking a bunch of other swim related classes. Since they helped me, I returned them the favor and taught Marshall (the middle brother) some tricks on a skateboard. I can't wait o see how much he progressed.","Right now I'm enrolled into a college course from by school. It's an amazing opportunity, but the problem is, I was enrolled later than everyone else, and just recently got my College course email and database. Since I just got the account, I was really behind on a couple of assignments. If I didn't get those assignments in soon, there would be a lot of difficulties. That week, I was freaking out. I was going to all my friends for help but It was hard to ask for help. I hate being a bother. It was what I had to do though. Getting help from friends in the course saved my butt. I did spend a couple nights up past 2am, but it was worth it. I'm finally up to date, and ready for the rest of the course.","I prefer working in a team. There's something about working with other people and creating a collaborative bond with those people that intrigues me. When you work alone, all the work is piled up on you. You can't rely on anyone besides yourself, and that sucks. I freak out and I have to pull all-nighters to get the assignment done.

I know that it will be a truly inspiring experience of working with passionate people that love computers as much as I do.","One of the many things that i find interesting, in the field of computer science, is programming. I believe that programming is the soul of a computer, although the hardware might be the backbones of it. When I initially began programming last September, I was eager to learn more and more ways of using it! Now that I have learned several languages, I find it amazing how a language can be translated to one's and zeros so a  computer can comprehend the commands. Developing algorithms is also interesting. Although solving a problem might be satisfying, there might be better and more efficient ways to solve it. This is why programming and developing algorithms are so interesting and somewhat exciting! ","If money were no object, I would love to attend UC Berkeley. Although I don’t really know a lot about colleges, I have heard that UC Berkeley has an amazing computer science program.  I would like to learn advance computer science topics in college, such as algorithms and maybe the hardware side of computer science. Software engineering seems like a tough profession, but I want to become one. Becoming a software engineer will help find ways of creating tools that people can use in everyday life, maybe an app or website. An obstacle that might prevent me from achieving my dream might be economical difficulties. My parents are immigrants and my brother is a freshman in college, so paying for both my tuition and my brother will be an obstacle that my family and i will face.","A hobby of mine is photography. I first got into it in the beginning of 2015, when my brother got a camera. Since i still had school during that time, because there were no breaks, I really didn’t have time to do it. But during the summer, i had some free time to do photography. I find photography really amazing because of how powerful images can be. Even a simple picture of a person can evoke a lot of emotion. I met some other photographer during the Summer that also had the same feeling as me. Street photography is what I love most of photography. We don’t really notice what we do when we are in the streets, especially in a fast-pace city like New York. So photography has helped me open my eyes and appreciate the things i am able to see and experience. Capturing ordinary people in ordinary situations can sometimes be so un-ordinary and special!","One project that has remain memorable to me is a computer science project where i had to imitate a route cipher. Although it has such a simple process, it did not mean it would be that simple when programming it. I remember spending full days trying to come up with an algorithm that would work. In my opinion, finding an algorithm that best works is far more difficult and important that coding it. When i finally finished my algorithm for the project, i began programming it. This step was far easier, because my algorithm made it simple for me to program it. When i first began it, i was daunted by such a task, because i didn’t know where to begin. But i took it step by step and finally finished. When i was finally finished, I was proud of the work i had done; now when I am faced with a task that I find difficult, I try to remind myself that it will only make me a better programmer and  thinker.","I prefer working with people in a project. Although I am most comfortable working by myself, I have found working with others better. Being able to gather ideas and work together has taught me a lot.

Something about being in a world where you become something that you can't normally be in real life is amazing to me. It made me feel as though I didn’t have to deal with real life or all of it's problems and all I needed to do was sit back and be in my own little world. However, in order to actually make these games I first have to study the basics. Before doing any character designs, story elements,  or creating any sort of maps I need to first know how to code. So, I decided to sign up to the All Star Code Intensive because its my best chance to get started and create something great for myself . By entering into this program I will have access to essential information for my desired trade that I would otherwise not be able to get.","Technology in general is fascinating to me because, like most of the current population , I use it on a daily basis to make my life easier. We use it to learn (computers, smart boards for teachers), we use it for entertainment (TV, movies, videos,etc) and we use it for communication. It makes the world go round. I would love to be part of the group that works to crate new innovations as a career. I feel that I would never be bored if I applied myself to this field. I would be able to spend my life challenging my mind and creativity and in turn, constantly evolving as a person.","If money were no object, I would want to go somewhere far away from the US. Probably a place like Japan or Canada, to get a new type of feel and a different envirornment to be a part of. The world is so huge and I am just living in a small portion of it. I would love to get in touch with the world and having the money to study abroad and travel would be an amazing expirience. I would use the money to broaden my horizons and those of the ones I love. I would also invest in something that would continue to make my future better and fund some kind of resource to give back to those in need. ","Last Summer,  I participated in the Summer Youth Program. From this program I was able to study film making. Basically, while I was there I was taught how to film a movie, how to edit a movie and even the different ways to shoot a movie. It gave me a clear idea of the amount of work it takes to make your own movie and how it's not easy to make one. It also introduced me to careers in technology and allowed my interests in them to blossom.","One project that made me struggle a lot was a summer reading project that required me to not only read the 150 page book but to also make a presentation, biography on the author and a 2 page essay on the plot. It was such a challenge because it had to be done in a month and a half yet it required me to manage the time I had and work on multiple aspects of the project at once instead of going outside to do what I wanted. It was a true task because there are so many things I could have done instead of the work such as watching TV or going outside which I love doing. Still, I did what I had to do and stuck with my schedule. It taught me to be responsible and that sacrificing time for responsibilities does pay off. ","I prefer to work as a part of a team rather than by myself because there is more to accomplish that way. Instead of giving all the work and stress for one individual, you can divide the work to get it done faster. Its way better than having one person rush through and do something subpar.

Well, I hadn’t felt that prior to going to a YoungHackers hackathon around two years ago during the summer. I had worked on some computer science projects but the AllStarCode alumni had a motivation and drive which I hadn’t seen in any other computers science program in the city. The idea of being in a community of people of color learning this amazing field and breaking into a field, which only has around two percent black representation, inspired me to want to be a part of this program. I would have applied right then and there but alas I had an academic program which made me unable to apply to AllStarCode. I spent two years yearning to join this community, and learning amazing things about it either through going to the LocalHackDays or speaking to alumni provided me an even more intense enthusiasm in regards to joining. ","Two things excite me most about technology: the accessibility to create products rapidly and the ever-changing nature of technology. For centuries, creating a business or creating invention required immense amount of capital, and network of others to act as the middlemen to sell the product. Technology removes the middlemen and allows anyone with a laptop and internet connection to create the future. That’s what truly excites me about technology, the ability to define what the world will be in the next ten, fifteen, or hundred years. The fact that no one day within the technology sector is the same as the one prior enraptures me. I could never work in a field where I’m not always learning new things every day. Working in the technology sector forces you to be constantly learning new languages, frameworks, and tricks. ","If money were no object, I would leave the country for college and go to University of Waterloo, and major in Philosophy and Computer Science with a minor in Graphic Design. I would go to UWaterloo because I feel like during this transitory period of my life, I would love to leave the country and learn about the world around us. A key tenet of my life is the need to experience new things while I’m still young and able to. UWaterloo is an amazing school for Computer Science and I would love to do their Co-Op program, which would accompany work experience with learning in the classroom, an experience for the most part I wouldn’t have in the States. My major choices are primarily just following my two passions – Computer Science and philosophy. I want to not only be able to code the future but I also want to be able to view from an ethical stance, the merits of creating a product or not. For example, with creating Artificial Intelligence, I would love to not only code AI personas but determine if certain features should be put in from an ethical standpoint. Some obstacles which might prevent me from achieving that dream is a limited income, few family members in Canada, and the rigorous application process for admittance for international students. If I were to apply to this school, my financial aid package wouldn’t be good, and most likely I would be unable to pay for tuition. Even if I were, I have very few family members in Ontario, Canada, specifically, thus making it diffic","Last summer, something I did which was important to me was take an earnest look at my life, figuring what do I want to be and how will accomplish that. Through the Opportunity Network Summer Institute, (a four – week preparatory program teaching networking, and professionalism) and participating in a design camp in North Carolina, I was able to learn what to do for my future self. So, for the portion of my summer unoccupied by these programs majority of my summer which wasn’t occupied by those two programs, I spent working on self – improvement and creating routines that I would be able to get work done faster, so I would be able to work on my passion projects or learn something new. These routines that I worked on during the summer have made the biggest difference in how I work at school because I’m able to finish my work in half the time it took me before, and I’m not taking on huge amounts of stress. ","I’ve struggled with the creation of my club, the Literary Magazine. My club existed before in my school but due to the teaching advisor for the club retiring the year prior, I had to start anew – creating a curriculum for the club, finding printers in order to publish, sourcing work, finding members and a lot of their responsibilities. When we began school last year, I felt this struggle to properly manage this huge project, and by having to focus on my academics, I felt like I was never doing enough. As an organization, we definitely struggled over the first couple months with getting submissions and members. I personally found a balance in my school/club life and was finally able to work on this passion of mine: publishing a magazine. I spent days and nights working with our group members trying to review over new submissions and attempting to create a unique flow/design for this project. This truly taught me how to work hard. Frankly, I hadn’t felt pride in something I’ve done in school until this point. I might have pulled all-nighters to work on this project, but looking at our end result I would have never done otherwise. ","I love working on teams, but I do admire solo time to compose my thoughts and better provide the group ideas. I think solo time is necessary to do the research, and mentally process the ideas while group time should be the time to incubate and produce new methods. I feel most creative when working in a group but most productive when working either in a pair or alone. Groups are definitely better because you are able to maximize each individuals’ weaknesses and strengths to make a cohesive product in the long run. Working in a team provides me with a motivation I usually don’t feel working on solo projects, and I’m more willing to put more energy in a project if I have a group around me.",6,Yes,dmomplaisir@icloud.com,241582662,dmomplaisir@icloud.com,,Dylan Momplaisir,,,1,Dylan Momplaisir,Alley,4,8,8,Rally,"HTML, CSS, JS, Python, C, databases",Difficult switching to a different way of thinking (using different solutions for a problem),CEO of new distribution compnay,,Stubborn,Tech,Tech,1

There are so many different forms of technology, and each is developing and improving in its own unique way. Intellectually, I don’t want to be left behind while technology constantly advances, so I want to be able to keep up with the consistent growth of job expectations and adjustments. The particular areas I’m interested in is mostly in programming and types of game development, as well as learning what makes certain computers work, so I can exercise that information in future projects I may have in mind. ","The college I would most likely go to is Pace University, and study computer technology. This will give me the opportunity to learn more about software engineering, programming language concepts, and web development.

 ","Last summer, I went to a full-week program called ID Tech. I wanted to try out the program to see what it was all about at first, and took a small class in RPG Game Design. This interested me immensely, and planned on going this summer. This camp was important to me because it helped me get acquainted with a working atmosphere, and taught me how to manage projects as well as using development tools.","A time where I struggled with something and overcame it was when I was working on a personal major assignment and was required to have the knowledge on how to maintain and operate a certain system. At first, I did not know how to use the equipment, thus making the main task impossible. What I had to do was look up tutorials and study the different mechanics used to handle the system, and apply that to my first objective. Gradually, I learned by taking on each process individually step by step. Once I fully grasped the idea of the concept, I successfully completed the assignment, as well as gained the insight on how to do future assignments similar to that one.","I usually prefer working as part of a small team, because I believe when minds that think alike come together and focus on one task, the greatest creations are made.

This program is designed for students who aspire to become engineers. Since September 2015 we have been learning and applying principles of computer coding and applications. Many concepts in the course are similar to my experience with the All Star Code Hackathon which I participated in this past December. I am intrigued by what the summer intensive has to offer me. When I return to school, I will understand a lot more about my desired field of study. Aside from Instrumentation and Automation, there are not many outside resources for me to pursue my interest in coding. The All Star Code program would be an excellent opportunity for me to develop and sharpen my skills, and provide a place where I can meet people with similar interests and exchange ideas.","Technology is a key component of today’s modern age.  I find technology fascinating because of its ability to instantaneously spawn new ideas and creations.  Computer gaming is a great portrayal of my fascination of technology.  A particular area that interests me is software development, specifically for computer gaming. Although most computer games are created for entertainment, some people are inspired by their favorite games to start coding software.  Often after their first creation, coding enthusiasts continuously improve upon and modify the technology to increase the game’s satisfaction and ratings.  I see myself coding in this type of setting.","If money wasn’t an obstacle, I would apply to and attend Stanford University to study computer or chemical engineering.  For me, Stanford represents the best of place for two of my biggest goals; excellence in academics and excellence in soccer.  Stanford is a top 5 engineering school and a top 5 soccer school. Money is just one of the challenges to attending a school like Stanford.  With thousands of applicants each year, getting accepted into Stanford is a big challenge.  My dream of being able to do both things I love at the highest level in one setting is my greatest desire.  However, my financial situation is an obstacle.  Without full scholarship, I would be unable to attend.  I will continue to work hard and work smart in pursuit of my dreams so I can hopefully get a full scholarship. ","One thing I had hoped to do last summer was to attend the Next Generation tournament with the New York Red Bulls 13/14 team. This prestigious tournament is conducted in Austria beginning on August 13th. After a decent season with the team, I had fully expected to be a selected member of the team. A month before the trip, I was told that I had not been selected to continue playing for the NY Red Bulls Academy. This news came as a great disappointment, but it also taught me a lesson. Since I had planned my entire summer on this trip, I had not planned any other major summer activities. For the rest of July and August I stayed home, worked on summer assignments, and practiced my soccer drills when I had the chance. Next summer, I will have a backup plan in case my original plans fall through.","Ninth grade was the most difficult year for me academically. For the first two quarters, I struggled in my Geometry advanced class.  Previous to ninth grade, I had not needed to study as hard for math, because it was easy for me to comprehend. However, I found it difficult to grasp nearly everything the teacher was saying during class, and my notetaking skills were poor. In the second semester, I focused on writing detailed notes.  When I still didn’t fully grasp the concept, I relied on outside sources to assist me. I utilized Khan Academy tutorials, and YouTube tutorials to help me better understand concepts and I met with the teacher weekly to review homework problems I had completed.  These strategies helped to improve my average from a 74 in the first quarter to a 92 in the final quarter.  When a lesson or a task is difficult, it is best if we ask for help and then practice, practice, practice.","I prefer working as part of a team, knowing that the combined talents of individual members can produce a more well-rounded and effective result than a solo project. I believe however that my individual contribution comes from practicing my trade on my own. A team is defined as a group of people working together to achieve a desired goal.

I think i would choose to be something in Technology because it grabs my attention and i figure that it's an industry that is currently growing and in the future it will be extremely big and will earn me a good amount of money.","Last summer i went to go visit my family in Ecuador, it's always a great time when i go visit them because I can see my sister and spend some time with her. In Ecuador i got to help my uncle with his job so i did get paid some times, but i helped him with simple stuff in his shoe business. This trip to Ecuador was extremely important to me because i was able to see my family and my family in Ecuador treated me as an adult and it was a pretty good experience doing stuff on my own without my parents near me. It was also really cool to bond with some of my cousins, in Ecuador I have to speak Spanish because no one really knows English. Thankfully my parents taught me how to so it wasn't very difficult to do so.","We had an assignment due for our Global History class in 9th grade, it was a day before it was due and i was almost done typing the whole assignment and i was revising for any mistakes i have done.

I understand that merely improving my grades will not be enough, and that is one of the many reasons why I have decided to apply to the All Star Code Summer Intensive program.
","Last summer, I interned at a Chinese language summer camp as a teacher’s assistant. Up to this point in my study of Chinese, I had not practiced my Chinese outside of the classroom extensively, but I thought that I should be able to handle this job. As you can probably guess, it was not easy. My job involved teaching young children, diffusing arguments, and other tasks common in a summer camp setting, but there were many times when I did not know how to express myself efficiently, especially to children. Learning inside the classroom only applies to the real world to a certain extent, and as a result I was not completely prepared for the job at first. However, I quickly realized this and made my miscalculation an opportunity to improve my Chinese. I wrote down all the words that I did not know that came up on a daily basis at the camp and studied them at home, eventually incorporating them into my own vocabulary. By the end of the camp, I was able to comfortably do my job as a teacher’s assistant, and I learned a lot during the process. Although it was awkward and difficult at times, my experience as a teacher’s assistant taught me that hard work does result in success.
","Last year, my class was assigned a research paper in history class. This was the first time we were given freedom in the context of a history paper. We were all given a large list of topics we could freely choose from, and we could meet with our teacher when needed, but past that it was up to us to write our research papers. I decided to pick a topic that I knew little to nothing about but I found interesting, the Chinese Cultural Revolution, which turned out to be one of the best mistakes I have ever made. Although I had to do an enormous amount of research just to become familiar with the period I was writing about, my experience taught me about time management because my teacher expected us to be able to manage our own time. Previously, I did not manage my time well for school work, but with a project as large as this one, I realized that I needed to, otherwise there was no way of me completing the assignment. Ultimately, I did well on my paper, but, more importantly, I taught myself a lesson about time management.
","I prefer working as part of a team, because a team of people will always be able to produce a better product than one person will ever be able to. A group of people will be able to offer a diverse set of skills that one person will most likely not have. Furthermore, a team is able to collaborate and assign people to specific tasks, ensuring that everything is done thoroughly, whereas a single person will not be able to do the same thing nearly as efficiently. On a more personal note, working as a team can keep morale high which makes working on projects more enjoyable, while working alone on a large project can feel overwhelming.

The main reasons are my interests in the field of technology. I’ve always wanted to know how to code & be able to build things with the help of technology. I don’t have enough knowledge about this field; such as coding or engineering and I feel that I need it, in order to pursue my future goals in life. This year in my school, I had the privilege to take a computing programming elective. I saw this as a way to start learning more about computers & coding however after taking the class I was able to see how interesting and how much I really liked being in the atmosphere of a quick learning environment and to be so proud of the smallest of accomplishments with coding was one of the most memorable moments of my year. Not only do I think it will benefit me greatly in the amount of knowledge that I will obtain but I also think the way the program will play out in my future will be great since it will introduce me to a new learning environment and in a way introduce me to the real world. ","Technology is so vast and it has so much untapped potential that it excites me to know that there is more to discover in the next years. It may find cures for diseases that we thought incurable, it could build structures we may not even think possible of now and to think how there are areas of jobs that were made by technology makes me wonder if there will be new jobs to be made in the near future. However that isn't the only thing that I find interesting about technology but also the fact that has many different fields and has a large variety of things to choose from. Therefore, I believe the part that interests me the most is AI or Artificial Intelligence. This part interests me because AI is something that I hope to one day make, a system that can manage itself and doesn't need the help of any human is so infatuating I love to think about it. How we can make something so smart or knowledgeable that it can be independent and not need us, it is so amazing. I would love to one day design AI to what purpose I do not know of yet. AI is so interesting and will become vaster into the years to come.","If money were no object I would like to go to MIT. MIT is a school that everyone talks about for its reputation however if I were to go there I would rather bask in their privileges provided to the students that go there. Some of these privileges include their extensive research facilities as well as their notorious 3D printers and unique machines made by students there. My dream in MIT would be to transition myself into an excellent computer scientist major who has the ambition to improve. Furthermore, I think MIT would provide the challenge I want in a college because I know it would require so much determination of me as well as maximum effort in order to make it through. I would love the challenge since it would push me to be the best I can be as well as exposing me to a vigorous amount of knowledge. The challenges that may come in my way would be my determination to give it my all in the school as well as showing my deserving of an enrollment there and its exposure to my future career path in computer science. My biggest challenge would be to keep up my good grades and the transition from being a student in high school student to college.","Last year for summer my father took me to Peru to visit family and friend we haven't seen for some time.   This event was very important to me because I haven't been to Peru since I was a child and so I got to look at it with a new perspective adolescent eyes and I saw its poverty. I saw how poor the country was as well as its delays in technology. This made me think for a while as I realized how privileged I was to have what I have. Ever since my trip to Peru I’ve thought of going back when I’m older with a more mature train of thought as well as some education with me to help the people in Peru who are less fortunate. I know people in Peru that are extremely intelligent and love to learn and have the ambition to go forward but they are restricted by their poverty, one example is my cousin who lives in the farmland in Peru, she is very poor but has ambition to learn and be the best she can be and she actually inspired me to want to help the less fortunate because not only are they missing out on a better lifestyle we as well are missing out on their hidden brilliance clouded by bias and lack of opportunity. My dream would be to one day get the people in Peru who are less fortunate the resources they need to succeed. Peru was an important trip to me because it opened my eyes to a different spectrum and I was able to see how lucky I am through my many visits to relatives and friends.","When I was six years old my father brought my family and I to the US and one difficult challenge at the time for me was learning to speak English. Speaking English was one of the hardest challenges of my life, as it would help me transition to a new world it was more than a language, to me it symbolized the change around me and the changes that I would have to make with them.  The way I learned English was through the help of my teachers and my mother staying up with me every school night to teach me English, the constant repetition and perseverance to learn. It took me one year to learn English and it was extremely hard for me, I have many memories of wanting to give up wanting to go back to Peru and forget about the US and learning English forever but my parents helped me persevere and taught me to never back away from a challenge because no matter how hard it may be it's not just a challenge of will it's a challenge of self worth. A way to show I have what it takes to overcome the challenge and strive from it and thanks to my parents guidance I was able to do it I was able to learn a new language. However it wasn't all due to my parents even though they guided me and motivated me my English teacher was also a very big part to my success she was the first teacher I ever had to not just give me busy work and expect what is necessary from me, she wanted me to thrive and work to my fullest potential.",I don't mind working in a team atmosphere since I like to hear other people’s ideas and their perspective on a certain subject. However if I was giving the opportunity to work alone I would like that as well since I would have full control over all decisions  and full responsibility. Over all I would prefer to work as a team since I would be able to get constructive criticism from my peers in order to improve my work. Working in a team would also provide me with a safety net of people to count on if I were to have an idea that perhaps I wasn't so confident of displaying alone but would be able to share with the confidence of my team. I believe in working with teams not only for the ideas we could share with each other but also so we can build a trust in each other that will help us get to know each other. Teams are good in helping each other and cooperating they help develop co working skills and teach people how to take constructive criticism as well as judgments.,5,Yes,5138franko@gmail.com,242208772,5138franko@gmail.com,Franko Espinoza,Franko Espinoza,,checked,1,Franko Espinoza,MLB,2,8,N/A,Which came first?,"JS, databases, API, physical computing, algorithms, HTML, CSS, JS","Would ""Dare Greatly"" but didn't want to put in the work needed to accomplish the goal",Will apply CS to social justice issue in college.

My interested in math and science began at a young age. The schools that I have attended helped foster my interest and passion for the sciences, particularly engineering. It would be an honor to attend this summer program to further enhance my understanding of math and science; as well as cultivate my interest in the field of engineering. I believe that this program will contribute to my future success as a college student with an intended engineering major. All Star Code, being a prestigious community for fostering learning and growth would be an excellent place to further enhance my learning and future success in the field of engineering.
","Like many young male children, I had an incredible fascination with robots and technology. I dreamt about what it would be like to have a robot servant and what the future holds in regard to technological advances. I possessed a curious mind, wondering about the intricacies of many electronic devices, such as my Gameboy console and television remotes. This led me to my disassembling of such items to satisfy my curiosity. Ever since then I wanted to venture into any field of study involving video games and technology.","If I could go to any college, I would go to Oswego. I think the opportunity they would have for me would be great and since it is close to home it is perfect to keep in touch with my family. I would study Computer Engineering there at Oswego because computers are a gateway into the life of technology and dealing with data and coding is a dream. One major obstacle that I might face while achieving my dream would be racism. Racism is a big factor that would weigh me and others applying into this program down. It is a shame that just from the color of my skin I can’t receive the same opportunity as others. Overall, there would be many obstacles that might prevent me from achieving my goal but through hard work and perseverance I will overcome them.","Last summer, I helped out my local Sunday School with bible lessons. I read to the children attending the school and sometimes read to the entire congregation on Sundays. I often helped to provide the children with an example of how to be a good person and a good Christian. I was respectful to the children, and they were respectful to me. This is important to me because giving back to the community is very important and it is best to start with the younger generations first to mold and shape them to become the leaders of tomorrow.","When I was in 9th grade, I struggled immensely with understanding and learning Spanish in school. It was hard studying a new language in addition to getting accustomed to my new school. It was difficult to remember the vocab and write out the words accurately so one day I just sought out for help from both my mother and my Spanish teacher. I instantly showed better results and ended up passing Spanish with an excellent grade. I was afraid to look for help, but I overcame my fear to better myself.",I prefer to work as a part of a group because it is better to share and collaborate your ideas together with other people to gain more knowledge from different perspectives on the subject.

Since I want to be a software engineer in the future, All Star Code will help me achieve my dream. With ALL Star Code, the staff and their training will help me with technical skills like programming games and/or coding websites.","Every year, there are many breakthroughs in technology that fire my neurons. When that happens, I try to find out how it works and observe the hardware. In other words, reverse engineering things it but not quite. The breakthroughs excite me about technology and specially the software. For example, when 3D touch was introduced, it blew my mind. All screens used to be 2D and when you touch the screen, it wouldn’t measure the sensitivity but Apple changed that with their new IPhone 6s. That development was fascinating to me and I wanted to learn more.

One particular area that highly interest me is programming. It interests me because of the vast library of languages I can learn and excel in. In my high school, my teachers have taught me the basics of programing in HTML. I also passed the IC3 GS4 certification exam and I believe All Star Code will help me build on that. Also maybe become the next Bill Gates.","If money were no object, I would go to Carnegie Mellon because of their top computer science program. If I were in Carnegie Mellon, I would study computer science but specially software engineering because to solve problems using software that can change the world is what I go to school for. However, there are obstacles that stand in my way of achieving that dream – the obstacle is me. I am an obstacle to myself because I can be lazy and procrastinate on things while on the other hand I can be productive and focus. “The only thing standing between you and your goal is the [lies you tell yourself]” said Jordan Belfort. Even though, I am my own obstacle, I won’t let myself get in between me and my dream because I will be productive when its time instead of procrastinating to tomorrow.","While I did not participate in any programs last summer, I was at home, I was researching about the career I wanted to pursue and learning to code mostly. Learning more of the career I wanted, help me analyze which major and programs such as All Star Code will help me become a Software Engineer. My prudent research helped me prepare for next year signing up for All Star code. In addition, I also texted my best friend that attended All Star Code 2015, Elhadji Faye, to learn about All Star Code.","The high school I attend is an early college that is partner with Guttman Community College. With the partnership, came a free two year Associates degree in Applied Science. This semester, the students that took and passed the ELA Regents in 9th grade will start the college course but I didn't take Regents exam. Even though, me, my peers, and my teachers thought I was ready, I did not take the regents. However, My principal assigned a mock ELA Regents to the people she thought was ready and didn't take the ELA Regents Exam. However, I didn't pass with a high score. This was challenging to me because everyone thought I was ready but the test wasn't showing it. My teachers and my principal knew I was ready so I submmited an appeal of why I should be admitted to the college course. Later that week, I got called for interview, I advocated for myself I was later that week accepted.","I prefer working solo because of my ideas being heard and I what I say goes.

I have sometimes had conversations with my friends, who are extremely tech savvy, and they make references to computer or phone parts that I have never heard of before. Joining this program will not only introduce me to new parts and functions of everyday electronics, such as cellphones and laptops, but it will help me to acquire knowledge on all the steps and factors that goes into making modern-day technology which makes our lives easier. In addition, the way games on computers are made fascinates me. I have played many of them, and the amount of creativity and depth of the game has made me more and more curious as to how exactly it is done. ","When it comes to technology, there are many things that I seem to be extremely fascinated by. The amount of creativity and ingenuity that goes into creating an electronic device had inspired me to attempt to create something new and unique, but then I try to brainstorm ideas and end up just sitting there wondering what I could possibly make that would entertain people. I just end of forgetting about it, but eventually it cones up and I repeat the cycle. One of these topics that has inspired me is mobile phone development. I have heard that it takes a company such as apple approximately four months to make a phone, but then spends a couple of years to fix the bugs on the phones. This has made me wonder exactly how easy it is to design and create a phone, and how many bugs must be dealt with before it can be sent out to the public. As well as bugs, there are ways for companies to make sure that there is data wherever the customers go. There are towers strategically placed to ensure that customers get the best quality out of the network, but what exactly goes into making these towers? Are there certain minerals that are used to make electronic charges that help power the tower and provide data, or is it just simply typing in codes and information into computers that then transmit the data to the nearby area? This is what has completely caught my attention when it comes to technology.","If money wasn't an object, I would most definitely go to Georgetown University and study Law. It has always bothered me when I see somebody inefficiently represented in court. The lawyer gets compensation whether he wins or loses, and some don't care about the actual case and saving somebody's life. Their main goal is to make the money and continue living their lives, and it has angered me to an extent where I have looked on the internet for countless hours, studying the consequences that can be received if a lawyer were to do a terrible job at trying to represent his/her client. Seeing people being freed after serving many years in prison for wrongful convictions makes me wonder why they were actually falsely convicted to begin with. Where were their lawyers in the first place?
The obstacle is that I don't know where to begin.","Last summer, I went to Carlsbad New Mexico with my family. We drove into Roswell where there have been many sightings of aliens. I also visited the Carlsbad Caverns, which was more than seven hundred feet underground. There are toilets, electricity, and even a working elevator that brought us back up to the main floor. When I saw all this, I was baffled at the advanced technology that made it possible for me to use cellular service while waiting on line more than seven hundred feet underground for the elevator to arrive. It made a mark on me. There are functioning toilets and all kinds of modern amenities down there. I became progressively curious as to how this all works, and this is why I would like to join this program.
This trip was important to me because I have not been to the Southwestern part of the country before. I did not know that some part of the country was so hot. It was 116 degrees Fahrenheit while we were there. I also visited the Living Desert and saw different kinds of desert animals and plants.We drove to El Paso and Las Cruces. The landscape was impressive along the way. There were many different kinds of animals such as cows and horses that could be seen grazing on the farms. But the most important thing about this trip is that I got to see my dad.","When I was in elementary school, there was a subject that I could not comprehend at all. It was full of formulas and complicated word problems that only contributed to severe headaches for me. This subject was math. Even till today I do not understand the importance of half the things we learn. The Law of Sine would help me figure out the side lengths of a triangle with unequal angle measurements, but that is all it will ever help me with. Memorizing the formulas has proved a challenge, because it is so easy to mix up one with another, and once you realize your mistakes, it is back to the beginning. I have studied math, and despite the fact that I got a 94 in geometry this year, I still struggle at it and this has made me to dislike it, but I have kept on studying it everyday to help me get better at it.","I prefer working solo, mainly because I feel like being with a group holds me back. I can have an answer to a question, but will have to explain it to the person or group and sometimes it takes time to get everyone to see the same point. Being alone, I don't have to wait for other people to show up and sometimes they are not as dedicated as I am and that can be frustrating, especially if a project has a deadline.

Furthermore, programs like this will help improve my team working skills as well as help me create relationships with other aspiring young minds to reshape the coding world of tomorrow. ","For me personally, I enjoy creating games and sources of entertainment with my coding knowledge. I am extremely interested in learning how to use various game engines to create games as well as various languages like C++ and Java to create my own games. Video games excite me the most in terms of technology because I am intrigued by the way that a team of people collaborate and use their skills to create a virtual experience for a player. I personally believe that creating and designing games is its own art form and I hope to expand my knowledge of programming languages so that I may further develop my skills as a game designer and developer. ",If money were no object I would want to go to a college where I could study both Computer Science and Game Design and master both skillss so that when I graduate I could start working with a team of other passionate game developers to create games for my own individual studio.

This could hinder me as I progress toward my future since collaboration is key for one to express their ideas to a group as well as receive input from the group to formulate different solutions.   ,"Last summer I was hired as a junior counselor at a camp called Incarnation Camp, which I had been attending as a camper for the last 3 years. While working there I was in charge of supervising, caring for and raising children while we lived in an outdoor environment separated from technology. This was an important experience in my life as it was my first experience in taking care of children that were not closely related to me prior to me knowing them. Over time I had to create these relationships with people I had never known that had different backgrounds from both me and each other. Working at the camp I developed the skill to be able to relate to and work with these children so that we could all enjoy our summers together.  ","In my first two years of high school I struggled with learning Spanish as a foreign language. For me, I had significant trouble in remembering how to use conjugations properly. I struggled for a long time with this, trying different study methods in an attempt to improve my ability to memorize. It wasn’t until I started using Spanish in my day to day life where I wasn’t used to using it that I started to develop a form of familiarity with the language. From there I have become more involved in my Spanish class in hopes of mastering the language so it can become a part of my daily life. ","I prefer working in a team because when working as a team I am able to hear multiple viewpoints and different approaches on how to solve a problem. When working in a team I am also able to suggest ideas to other people so that I can get feedback and get advice on how to improve my solution. Furthermore, working on a team allows me to use my own talents and input, along with the talents of others, to complete a common goal.",4,Yes,jamalcwoods@gmail.com,242429520,jamalcwoods@gmail.com,,,,,0,Jamal Woods,Alley,8,8,8,Locus,"HTML, CSS, JS, Firebase, arduino, presentation skills, python",Focus,Founding his own tech company,Played games while others worked; had a strong grasp of the material,Focus,Tech,,0

The person who recommended me this program told me how great of a program it is to learn how to code from the beginning. I always wanted to understand what and how coding works. Being in a world that is now filled with technology I want to be part of it and being in this program will help me get a glimpse of how all these technologies work and how the world works as well. With me being in this program I will be able to learn and use a new language which is greatly used in this world today. It will also help me in my future career of being a Engineer. Being a part of the All Star Code Summer Intensive program will help me open doors that will lead me to what I want to become later in the future.,"What really excites me about technology is the advancements of technology. How it evolved from huge monster computers with tons of wires and connections to an iPhone that is small and compacted with the same processing power of a computer today. How we now have drones in the sky when before we wouldn’t think it was possible. We have cars, well soon, that drive by themselves and soon enough have flying cars. We have robots that can walk, run, and talk to us when we ask them questions. Even kick a soccer ball and chase it. Have a watch on your wrist that we can use to talk and text as we do on our phones. Just everything about technology makes me excited and I just want to be a part of it. What interest me the most is the making of it and the things that actually make these technologies work. One of them being the coding of it Without coding the machine or whatever the device is will not work. So knowing the language of coding is very useful in today’s world and my path of becoming an Engineer.","The college that I would go to will be MIT for engineering. Why? Well because it’s is the number one school for engineering. I always wanted to go to that college ever since I wanted to be part of technology and become an engineer. The obstacles that might prevent me from achieving the dream of going to MIT and becoming an engineer is the SAT and the thought of not making it. The SAT is a hard test and I have to get a good score to be able to even be looked at from MIT. Seeing the requirement for that school is like impossible for me to even imagine myself being in the school. Without the SAT scores being good and the feeling of not making it, of not succeeding, might prevent me of achieving my dream of being in MIT, but it won’t stop me of becoming an engineer. Even though I didn’t achieve my dream of being in MIT, I can still achieve my dream of becoming an engineer in a different college.","Last summer I was in a program named “BlueStamp Engineering”, which was a six week program during the summer that was a hand-on program for kids that were interested in engineering. This, of course, was very important for me because of my interest of becoming an engineer. In BlueStamp they gave us a list projects, which we chose before the program actually started, that consist of robot and gadgets. I chose to make a electronic dice kit, which was my starter project, and an omnidirectional robot, which was my main project. During those six weeks I built those to projects by scratch with some help from my friends, that i made during the program, and the teachers who were there to help us. This program was very important for me because I introduced me to the mechanical and electrical side of engineering. It also introduced me to coding which I had no idea of how to do. This program gave me a glimpse of how engineering in the real-world works and made want to become an engineer even more.
My portfolio from BlueStamp Engineering:
http://www.bluestampengineering.com/portfolio-view/james-r/","The time that I struggled with something was my with grades from freshman year to sophomore year. In my freshman year I was still getting used to the school and my schedule of my classes. That unfortunately affected my grades. I was a 85 close to 90 and above student during middle school but my grades in freshman year were 80 and below. The classes for me were hard and my grades showed that. My grades were so bad that my mom had to go to my guidance counselor and had a meeting with my mom and myself. I said I’ll get my grades up and i did but not much. My freshman year was a horrible year for me. After my freshman year ended I said to myself that I will bring my grades up and not have bad grades sophomore year. Sophomore year I got easy classes and soon enough my grades significantly went up. I put my time into my homework and paid more attention in my classes and it paid off when I received my report card for the first marking period. Still wasn’t good as I wanted by I made to second honors. My mom was very proud of me and told me that I could do much better. My goal from that point was to get first honors. I put all my effort into all my work and soon enough I had 85s, 90s and above in all my classes for the next 3 marking periods. And in all 3 marking periods I made it to first honors. I accomplished a lot from the beginning of my sophomore year to the end of the year. I made my mom proud and I made myself feel accomplished.Sophomore year,overall, was the best year for me.",I’ll say both but I mostly prefer being part of a team. I prefer being part of a team because we get more ideas and can help each other with whatever we need help with. It is also efficient because one person can do one thing while the other person or persons do something else and whatever we are doing we will finish faster. We can also correct mistakes of each other and improve with what we are making or doing. It is also a good way to make friends faster and get to know each other better.

I simply want in on it - to learn what it is that makes the gears tick within everything from startups to video games. Between AP classes, SATs and the college process, I have little time or resources to teach myself how to code, though I still manage to come up with idea after Idea and fall short in the technical aspect of making them viable online. These ideas range from an online short story and narrative forum called Project Panopticon to a small start up business I started with two other friends called Word on the Street, which offers social media marketing and promotion to small local businesses in Westchester. (What really sucks is that I have no idea how to interact with online community bulletin's poorly designed APIs, which I need to figure out in order to post promotion automatically to these sites over fixed time intervals.) I am deeply fascinated with startup culture and revel in the ventures such as Warby Parker while also keeping a strong initiative to give back to my communities. I would love to provide an online presence for the youth group I started called Knights of Change, though, as of now, I simply lack the ability. I am bent on eventually becoming a programmer, though I seek All Star Code to help me expedite the process, and help me get many of my ideas off the runway.","I have been blessed with the ability to attend a private school outside of New York City on almost full tuition, though this does not mean I am not still close with the kids I once thrived with back home in Peekskill. Peekskill is relatively low-income, and predominantly of black and hispanic demographic. Recently, I enrolled in an innovation and entrepreneurship class, in which I rack up a pretty significant school budget in the creation process of a startup named Word on the Street Marketing. When sharing this class and of my business endeavors with my friends back home, the standard reaction is always shock, followed by a “must be nice.” This makes me think often about the unfair educational standards and inequalities that plague our society today. What excites me about technology and innovation the most is its ability to transcend economic barriers in order to bring people together and educate people. I draw inspiration from Much of what I see myself doing with my future life, is working to combat inequality through technology and innovation, to bridge the wealth gap by making resources available to everyone though socially conscious business strategies and promoting the use of technology in education. I love business and brainstorming and burning through startups, and I also love helping people, and I believe technology is the the vehicle towards making a better world.
","Where I would go to school is a little difficult. I really like either Harvey Mudd, or Bowdoin College. I definitely know what I would want to get out of school. I believe in the importance of a liberal arts education in today’s pursuit of a career in tech and business in order to broaden the mind. What I mean by this, is leaving the necessary room in order to allow myself to be creative, and be free to create as I please while drawing from eclectic influences. On the other hand, I do in fact have three options nearly locked down. Firstly, I am deeply interested in studying economics and find myself spending hours researching economic crashes - further fueling my inkling to tackle inequality. I really want to continue studying mandarin and be fluent by the time I graduate. Secondly, I want to definitely take coding or computer science classes in college so that I will be able to use technology to continue to foster and grow my ideas and help people. Lastly, I am good with people and have been voted class president of my grade for 3 years now and believe that I have talent to lead. Thus, I want to study business administration management in an ongoing long term goal of owning a tech startup.","Last summer I went to China for a month and it was one of the most eye opening experiences of my life. I went, after a grueling application process, with the Student Diplomacy Corps. With this group, I and nine others travelled to five different cities and explored the language and culture. The academic theme was sustainability in the environment, which was so crucial in the wake of China's worsening smog problems and pollution problems. I had entered with so many pre conceived notions that were challenged through meeting and living with my host families. The kids within the group from home really shocked me through the sheer diversity within the group, which I deeply enjoyed. I was discovering how diverse American teens from across the country can be, and that not only can you cross over and find similarities with them, together we were able to reach over and learn and experience camaraderie with the Chinese native, many of which did not speak andy English. I had the priceless opportunity to sharpen my language skills as well as gain navigation skills in critical cities such as Beijing and Shanghai. I embarrassed myself speaking what little mandarin I knew in from of everyone I met - in restaurants, at schools. I learned, most importantly, on this trip two important things: firstly is adventure, the second is trust and independence in myself. The freedom given to explore both academically and literally in the streets of China, has made me a wiser and more independent person.",This part of the application is incomplete as of now. I am requesting permission to submit this portion of the application in a later email. ,"In my school I find myself often in roles of leadership and positions that require a good deal of working within a team. Weather It me working with she students in my grade to plan a service event or dance party,  or discussing movies in the movie club I started, I have become adept at allowing space for others to work together healthfully and efficiently. Working as part of a team is also essential as a work towards developing my first start up business. Working in a team means, in that regard, means constantly being in late night skype calls and google hangouts to make sure that everything is correct. Personally I enjoy working in a group. They are a familiar setting. It also is important in taking on large and cumbersome tasks. No great startup got to where it is today with one lonely man or woman. Rather, he had a team working with him, supporting him, and making him better. In the same vein, he strives to make the people he works with work better, and the group function better as a whole. This has been a proven method of success in many businesses, and continues to be discussed in the development of the idea of business culture. This is what I personally seek out in my personal endeavors. I am personally a social person, and I thrive in small dynamic groups.",6,Yes,jfoxhall99@gmail.com,242440032,jfoxhall99@gmail.com,,Jared Foxhall,,checked,0,Jared Foxhall,Goldman Sachs,0,8,,Tweet Sweep ,"HTML, CSS, JS, API, databases",,CS degree,,,Tech,Tech,1

With joining the All Star Code Summer Intensive I can expand my knowledge in coding and possibly see if coding is a career I choose to follow.,The thing that excites me about technology is the endless possibilities you can do. Technology makes life more efficient and also is essential in the 21st century. Some areas that I am interested in is programming robots to complete complex tasks. Also creating simple apps on smartphones.,"If money were no object I would like to attend MIT because of its extensive computer science course it offers. Also, it's environment really attracts me. Some obstacles that would prevent me from achieving that dream is the location. It is not that far from New York City, but it would be hard to adapt to a new place. New York City has been a big part of my life, but going to a college like MIT would be worth it.","One thing that I did last summer that was very important to me was working out. I skateboarded a lot and biked around Prospect park almost every day. It was important to me because I learned how being fit was important. At the start, I couldn't do a lap around the park without getting really tired. After a week was able to do multiple laps around the park without getting really tired. With a lot of practice, anything can be achieved.","One time I struggled with something is with a personal project. I chose to do photoshopping. The problem was that I didn't know where to start.

One main reason why I am interested is because I want to expand my knowledge of code, as well as prepare myself for my future of coding and programing. With society advancing and becoming more dependent on coding and programing, I want to be able to prepare myself for the eventual technological-controlled world. I also want to be proactive and learn code before I go to college so that I can be one step ahead of my classmates.

Another reason why I want to be a part of the All Star Code Summer Intensive is to widen my network and get to know new people. Enlarging my network will open me up to many opportunities in the future like enrichment opportunities such as the All Star Code Summer Intensive, as well as internships and jobs. I hope to meet many interesting people, and would like to collaborate with my peers to create astonishing websites, apps, and games.

Lastly, I would like to learn how to apply code to the real world. I would like to learn how coding and programming jobs are, and what the working environment is like for jobs and companies that focus on computer science. Most importantly, I would like to enrich myself with knowledge in various coding languages.
","I am currently interested in the computer science field of technology, and a little bit of computer engineering. The idea of creating a game, or application that can make anyone’s life easier really excites and motivates me in that interest. Building computer also interests me, and I hope that I can incorporate that skill to my career in the future.

What really excites me about technology is that there are endless options to what you can create with it. For example, a cell phone or computer is easily accessible to many people, and with them you can create almost anything. You can create a website, a game, or even a bot that does things for you. The best part about it, is that if you make a mistake, it’s not the end of the world, and no major damage will occur in the real world.

Technology creates a world inside of our world, in the sense that you can create almost anything that comes to mind. Another thing that excites me is that technology is the future, and that many new technological advances make everyday life easier. Without technology like phones and computers, it would be hard to communicate, and do every day errands like sending an email or calling someone.
","If money were not an issue, I would want to study computer science or computer engineering at Brown University. The reason why I would want to study here is because it is a liberal arts school, and it offers many opportunities, as well as extra-curricular activities. The fact that Brown University is a liberal arts school would give me the opportunity to change my mind and experience new things. A liberal arts university like Brown would also help me to find myself and my interests.

I also want to study at Brown University because of their engineering school ranking, as well as their overall graduation rate. Brown University’s School of Engineering is ranked #49 and their School of science is ranked #20 in the United States. I don’t only want to go to these schools because of their ranking, but because of the environment, and the culture of the campus. The campus also has diversity, and many activities and opportunities to participate in.

Some things that can stand in the way of me going there is the distance from home, and sheer fact that I have no family in Providence. My parents are not too protective, but they would be worried that I am hours away from their reach in case of an emergency. This may be one of the only factors that would prevent me from attending this school.
","Last summer, I participated in the Opportunity Network Fellow Summer Institute program. The three week program allowed me the opportunity to meet over 100 other Fellows in my grade, and to meet professionals, as well as learn professional skills. We went on trips to companies such as Facebook, HBO and the New York Genome Center. Without The Opportunity Network, I wouldn’t know many of the skills I have to help me succeed.

This was extremely important to me because this program opens me up to many opportunities, supplies me with skills and tips to be more professional, and helps me in my academic life. Through the program I have learned many skills such as how to manage my time, how to send a professional email/write a professional letter, market my assets, and other useful skills. This program is also very important because it allowed me to establish a network, and to broaden it. I learned how to manage my contacts and how to stay connected with them.

Overall, I learned many professional skills through this program, and without it, I wouldn’t have been exposed to the skills I developed. I wouldn’t have the confidence to speak to new people, and have the boldness to make new friends. It has helped me in my professional, academic, and social life.
","One issue I struggled with was in my algebra 2/trigonometry and chemistry classes in 10th grade. My teachers for both classes had time articulating, and they also didn’t have a lot of patience for the students. Both of my teachers favorite phrases were “Come to tutoring!” but even when I went, I barely learned. Additionally, their grading system caused my average to take a toll. I found out that I wasn’t the only one who was struggling, so I knew something wasn’t right. After a while of barely learning, I decided to take it upon myself to solve the issue. I decided to create a healthy habit of studying more, and to watch videos online if I got stuck on anything.

Fortunately, I was able to pass each class even though my grades were low in both of them. Soon after passing the class, I ran into a bigger problem. I passed my chemistry regents, but I ended up failing my algebra 2/trigonometry regents. I felt devastated, and I wasn’t motivated to try again, but I am not a quitter so I kept studying to retake the regents.

I studied diligently so that I could pass the regents to make myself happy and feel accomplished. In the end, I accomplished my goal, and exceeded my own expectation with a higher grade than I expected to get.
","I am fine working in a team or by myself depending on the people I am working with. Sometimes it is great to have peers work by your side to accomplish a task. I can also work in groups, under the condition that my group members do their fair share of work. I have had experiences where I ended up doing all the work when I was supposed to be working with my group. However, working in groups is fun because you get to work with people who are unique and think differently than I do.

Working solo works perfectly fine with me. Because I get to monitor my own work, and make sure that I accomplish the task. I like working by myself in some situations because I know that I will finish my work, as oppose to working in a group where you are not sure that you group members will finish their share. Working solo is more reliable for me, because in the end I am satisfied with my work, and know that I put in all of my effort. Overall, I don’t mind working in either situation.

I want to challenge myself by expanding my coding knowledge and widen my network within the tech community. When I transferred schools my Sophomore year, they did not have that a computer science program, so I went to the assistant principal, who was in charge of technology at our school, and we started a tech team. Since we had only one person in charge of technology, what the tech team did was fix broken computers considering it was a big job for one person. We would also help teachers by creating websites for their topic such as social studies or math, and we would tweak our school website to look and be better. Within one year, this team grew to almost 50 people out of 1339 students.  I also advocated for more coding opportunities in my school.  The next year, my principal started a coding-based club called “scripted” with connections to google and microsoft.  Currently, me, the tech team and Mr.Sugiura (the assistant principal), are all working together to hopefully achieve A.P. Computer Science in my school by next year. I believe that the All Star Code Summer Intensive will be a great experience for me and will help me to become a better and much more efficient coder. It will be a great way for me to become more involved in the tech world and see what other possibilities there are with code and technology. ","As a kid, I used to love gaming. After playing one too many games as a 9 year old, I wanted to be the one to create the games because sometimes I would wish games had certain features that did not exist, such as the customization of characters or weapons. In order to learn how to create those customizations, I went to Youtube and discovered coding. Once I discovered coding, I would watch tutorials, play coding games through a MIT sponsored website called Scratch, and then I eventually self-taught myself how to code through an online program called Codecademy. I brought those skills that I learned through coding to school,  and I was able to help the school community by creating websites for teachers and the school. On a personal level, however, I was able to create some mediocre level games that I love to play, for example I created a basic maze game.  I think what excites me so much about technology is the endless possibilities of what can be done with technology. We can create apps, websites and games with technology, but that’s only the start. We see technology in space, in medicine, in entertainment, and it is only still expanding. ","If money was not in the picture, I would go to college at M.I.T. because that’s ultimately the hub of the STEM world in terms of academics. I would study computer science, business and computer engineering. I would study this because I want to become an entrepreneur and start my own business. Similar to how drones can be controlled through phone apps, I want to create robots that can be controlled through the use of your fingertips.  The only obstacle I see preventing me from getting into M.I.T. would have to be the financial conflict of affording that tuition and since about less than 8 percent of applicants are admitted, it intimidates me. In the long term however, I know I can achieve my dream with or without MIT.
","Last summer, I participated in Sponsors for Educational Opportunity (SEO) summer academy. SEO summer academy is a month long Summer Academy that features all-day classes Monday through Friday (for a total of 70 hours of English and 36 hours of math instruction). It is important for me because while other students forget what they learned during the school year, Through the summer academy I was able to become smarter and didn’t experience the summer regression that some of my friends did.  I really looked forward to SEO summer academy this year because the last week of the program was a 5 day coding week, where all scholars learned how to code. Since I am a little bit more ahead when it comes to coding, I was able to help my peers. Watching so many other fellow scholars coding together and building ideas for apps was my first experience of professional coding within a team. It was an experience that I really hold close because in order to go into coding in the future having an experience like this is really vital and advantageous towards my future career.  ","One time I really struggled in life was when I transferred schools; I started sophomore year in high school alone in a place where everyone knew each other. Not knowing that many people caused school work to be a lot harder also because I didn't have anyone to ask for help and I felt like a nuisance to the teachers, especially in AP World History.  I struggled a lot academically sophomore year, but I turned that all around. Eventually I overcame my fear and decided to go out of my comfort zone by meeting new people. I put in the extra effort to ask teachers for help. I went to tutoring as well as tutored others, and created study groups. I was finally able to gain those groups of friend in which we all helped each other succeed, and by the end of the school year I was able to excel in my academics.  ","I would rather work as part of a team because when I am working solo I am only limited to myself. Other people have different opinions and perspectives, knowing and seeing those different perspectives are important because it lets me see a wider view of the spectrum of a topic. Someone might see something a way I would have never thought of and that is important because it allows me to see the big picture. When working in teams, I can help others as well as receive help ultimately improving everyone’s skills in the team. Meanwhile, if I am working solo, and I do not know how to do something, then I am limited to myself. If I then become stuck because I don’t know what to do, then there is nothing that can be done. I will stay stuck. This is why I prefer being a part of a team considering you help each other grow instead of staying stagnate.",5,Yes,joel.cabrera@envirostudies.org,242196767,joel.cabrera@envirostudies.org,,Joel Cabrera,,,0,Joey Cabrera,Alley,6,8,N/A,Gen-Z,"High-level programming, HTML, CSS, JS, Firebase",Attendance,Tech work for non-profit,,Attendance,Tech,Tech,1

During this we would build these robots and once done we would program them to go through tracks while completing objectives. Another reason I’m interested is because I look up to my dad who tinkers with technology where he modifies modems and routers. The most prominent reason for my interest in this program is because in life I enjoy learning and things that are challenging. Since I’m a beginner I hope this program will teach me new things about technology and provide some challenging projects while doing so. ,"Technology excites me because you can make things happen like a robot moving through an obstacle course, create things such as a website, as well as communicating to people half way across the world just by writing lines of code. The other for my excitement about technology is because how it has become a part of most situations in life as well as how there is pretty always an improvement every couple of years. A particular area of technology that I am interested in is robotics because I’ve only worked with robots made out of Legos and I would like to see how more complex robotic structures work. Then another area of technology that I would be interested in is computer science because that area would help me improve my code writing which will help me if I were to study for video game design.","If money were no object I would go to University of Advancing Technology which is located in Arizona, and I would study game design, or robotics. The reason I would go to that university is because it’s centered on teaching technology and I would study robotics because I would like to learn more since I did a robotics program when I was younger. My reason for wanting to study game design is because throughout childhood I did most of the time which made me interested in them and this career would allow me to then make them. The objects that prevent me from achieving that dream are the fact that I live in New Jersey whereas the university is in Arizona and I’ve haven’t dealt with staying overnight in locations that aren’t my house very well. Another obstacle is obviously money since it costs much more to go to a university out of state than in your home state. As well as it would be a pain to go visit family during holidays because if I don’t have enough money to do so I pretty much stuck in a state where I have no family members whatsoever.","Last summer an event that was important to me was a trip to Dorney Park with my immediate family, my aunt and uncle, two cousins, and a family friend. While we were on this trip we brought food from home so we wouldn’t have to buy stuff in the park and we stayed in the water section of the park. This trip was important to me for two reasons one being that since both my parents are working most of the time we don’t get to interact much. The other reason is connected to the fact that my parents are working most of the time meaning that we don’t get many chances to leave the house to go to the movies, park, or if I’m invited somewhere.","A time that I struggled with something was during elementary school and the problem I struggled with was making friends. The reason I was struggling to make friends was because I felt uncomfortable talking to people I didn’t know and I wasn’t much of a social person. There is also the fact that I’m introverted so most of the time when I free time during class I kept to myself. To actually start making friends I did the only thing I could do which was stepping out of my comfort zone and started to interact with people. Basically instead of just listening and paying attention to the topics people were talking I started to add my own input. It also helps the fact that I found a group of people like me who can be sarcastic, don’t take things too seriously, and can laugh at themselves.",If I was working on a project I would prefer to work in as part of a team instead of working alone. When working in a team each member has weaknesses and strengths that other members of a team can help them with. Also when working on a team that works well together the project gets done much faster than when done alone. Plus while working on a team you are forced to interact with a group of people that you may or may not know which can create friendships. In the end I would rather work as a team because I would find that much more interesting and fun.,4,Yes,anthonycajuste306@gmail.com,238332601,anthonycajuste306@gmail.com,,Jonathan Cajuste,,checked,1,Jonathan Cajuste,Goldman Sachs,2,8,8,ANIM.EXE,"HTML, CSS, JS, API",Quiet,Will continue learning CS,,Quiet,Tech,Tech,1

Knowing well enough about computer and coding is a positive addition to your résumé. ","Technology may not seem to be a very exciting subject to many people. I believe it is a very good subject and it is intriguing. It is exciting because there are very interesting facts about technology that would make you ask even more questions. When it comes to technology, you practically always learn something about tech. Technology is changing the world 100% and there is nothing no one can do about it. Brilliant technology founders, such as Steve Jobs, are improving the world year after year. Mobile applications is included in one of the many things about technology. Being able to load things or search things up on your phone is a privilege. Technology can be anything and it is always improving/changing.   ","If money were no object, the college I would consider going to would be Manhattan College, Columbia University, or Albert Einstein College of Medicine. I would likely study medicine, health or engineering. I would like to study medicine and health because I am very curious on the wonders of the human body and the functions of the human organs; but I also would like to study engineering because they deal with scientific and mathematical problems that contribute on how certain things in the world function properly, including software engineers. These will help me launch my career so I can provide for myself and probably my children later on in life. There are quite a few obstacles that can potentially prevent me from achieving my goals. Financial load can burden and concern me and my parents because I also have siblings who go to a private school.","Last Summer, I had joined a boys and girls club. It was the first and only club I have gone to at all. At the boys and girls club, I did a variety of activities and they were very amusing and pleasurable. I had played basketball and also played in a basketball league. I had also been involved in a film make and music produce teaching lesson, which only lasted for 1 week. I been involved with weights and calisthenics. I also joined algebra to improved on my algebraic skills. I thought that this experience was important to me because it exposed me to notice other people races, religions and perspectives. This club was important to me because I experienced ups and downs during the experience and learned how to deal with the loss or the win. The club also gave me the opportunity to get out of the house everyday and receive fresh air. The club allowed me to meet new people safely without any trouble occurring. I had met people who had changed my life positively and gave me better outlooks on life.     ","Early in the 10th grade, I had struggled with the subject geometry. I was barely passing with a 66, and I felt really embarrassed to ask for help by my other peers. What made geometry so challenging to me was the complex formulas and simply remembering the formulas. I used to think I could easily remember the formulas and how to do the equation to receive full credit. When I saw my grade for that quarter, I felt that I wasn't working to my potential and decided that I needed to ameliorate my study habits. I decided to study everyday for 10 minutes in Geometry. In addition, I reviewed what I learned in that class at the end of the period to help remember what I have to do for a specific type of geometry problem.","I do enjoy working alone at times, but I prefer to be as part of a team.

I prefer working as part of a team because if we all have a specific job, then it would be better than a person who is working solo and doing all of the work. As a group, I get to bond with other people and being able to put aside our difference to do what is being ordered by the teacher/ professor.

You could learn the alphabet, letters system; and do simple math and have your vocabulary tested.

|How Carol taught the alphabet:
|The program printed a letter asked the user for the name, checked their response. If correct they were congratulated and then shown the toned versions of the letter; if wrong they were corrected and shown the toned version of the letter. Carol worked by holding the toned names, untoned names and the arabic letter in three separate arrays. A method that chose a random number picked a number to use of the whole loop to call values in each array. This works because indexes were set up ([1] �� , alif [1], a'lif [1],) all information about one letter could be called in one int going to all arrays. Based on the number a arabic letter was chosen and printed to the screen, after the question ""what letter is this?"" was printed on the same line. The user would then input a response on the next line which would be checked by the untoned word. The program then printed the pass or fail response based on sure input.

Your program is offering me so much more than just code; you have built a space where young men with similar interests can come together and break barriers and cut chains that have oppressed their communities for centuries. The program your offer is going beyond becoming a programmer but a Entrepreneur, a pioneer; educating us, and giving us some of the greatest resources an Entrepreneur can have contacts in, and exposure to the industry. As your site stated most black owned and operated start-ups never make it to the stage of being VC backed, so it’s very clear we’ll need all the help we can get. Another reason is that most Businesses fail ,and your program teaches students to admit the they have failed and then receive help, this teaches students not to give up in the face of failure because not only is it a part of the process, but overcoming it and learning from it are ways to succeed. This is why I loved the pbs newshour clip where a young man struggling admitted failure and he was cheered on and then helped by mentors and classmates. Preparation is also key in successful ventures and your program gives me the ability prepair in an environment with a hands on and applicable approach to learning, with the opportunity to meet young men that could eventually become business partners.","I want to see a world where people fly by by the tread of their clothing, wear living sweaters, and much more undisclosable fantastic seemingly impossible things and anything that brings me closer to making this a reality interest me. That’s why I’m interested in AI’s & machine learning, Manipulating Genetic Code (making GMOs), the Physics of levitation, and Nanotech, just to name a few. Outside of the product or device creation I’m really excited about technology offering me a medium for spreading ideas and creating media that can change how people view themselve and their environments. This is why I’m interesting in game develop because I believe that video game are a rich medium that can place people into other worlds. Creation and Exploration are really drive my thirst for technology.","I believe college is a place to not only learn but to also grow (spiritually, mentally, etc.), and in  order to choose a college I would need to travel and research a variety of Schools before I make a decision though undoubtedly  the school would need to be one to the best in the world .In this scenario I would still base my studies on an application for the hard sciences, but I would use the opportunity to gain gain a God's eye view of the world and myself, by studying history, religions, the human condition, music, languages along with other courses to open my mind. These this combination of hard science, design, business and history would give me a better perspective on myself and the world at large allowing me to make better choices on a daily basis, and in critical situations. Despite what an awesome opportunity this would be they’re some huge issues involved in this hypothetical. While money may be of no object time still dominates and getting an education like this in college would take a long time that could have been spent doing other things that would have given me a better return on investment,  and for that reason even if I could afford this kind of college education I would not buy it.","Most of my summer I did what most High Schools students do take college course to earn my associate's degree, and read some books, and tried to learn to code. One of the books I read Robert Kiyosaki’s “Rich Dad Poor Dad” really changed how I view the world. But say that his book completely changed my view on it’s own would be inaccurate, really this change started the summer of my 9th to 10th grade year, were desperate for cash  I sold bracelets on the sidewalks of nyc and putted in a profit equivalent to earning a little more than minimum wage (with clearing out my inventory), and decide that entrepreneurship was the life for me(learn a lot that summer, especially the fact that entrepreneurship a special kind of pain that i love), and grew with to want to become an investor as well. I went from wanting to be a scientist with a PhD, to wanting becoming a entrepreneur who hires a bunch of PhDs, and the help of Kiyosaki’s I realized that this goal was achievable, and that I could live a life freely even in a society that labeled me with prophecies of failure. Secrets of wealth no longer seemed like some whisper in the wind, but a an achievable token. Out of all the things I did that summer reading that book really was the most important thing I did, because belief is a weapon that has moved mountains, and having it is invaluable.","The academic challenge that I had to deal with happened in my junior year.  At that time, I was taking two AP classes along with four courses at a college to earn my associate's degree.  I was having difficulty managing my time and the stress of having both high school and college courses was having a negative effect on my GPA.  My family was coming down on me not only for my poor grades but also because I no longer spent any time with the family.  Ironic because they insisted that I take on the extra college courses.	Luckily I had a couple of teachers who helped me get through this.  They encouraged me to stay on at the college because they said “an Associate’s degree would in the long run make my college application stand out from others”.  They gave me some time management tips such as waking up earlier, allocating a certain amount of time to each course and sticking to that schedule, and most importantly to stop complaining. In other words, like the Nike slogan, “just do it!”  This turned out to be one of my better years, I had a 92 average in highschool, and got A’s and B’s in my college courses.  Like Shakespeare says, “all’s well that ends well”; well not quite.  There was that pesky little C I got in the English course, but overall I was more than pleased.","I make my preferences on this subject are based on the situations I face with any given task. Currently I work best alone because I have had limited experience working in groups, and therefor can’t make any accurate judgments on my preference. Despite this I’m still able to see where I would prefer an on option other the other. On larger projects that require skills that I’m not good, or don’t have I’d definitely love to be in a group, the work would be completed faster,  I’d have people to learn from, and keep me accountable. Though working alone definitely has it’s advantages especially on small projects where you have a good grasp of the material at your disposal. Though the internet allows people to very easily bridge this gap, and solo work is great of educational purposes.
Though I do lack experience working in groups I believe I would prefer to do so, because I can dream.

Even though I've been to other summer camps, they weren't as interesting as I thought they'd be.

During 7th and 8th grades, I took courses in Scratch and Hackety Hack. Hackety Hack was awesome because it was easy to use,interactive, and I was able to create programs on my own. During 8th, I also took a course in Alice, and became more interested in computer coding. I haven't had any computer coding classes since middle school. I also would like to go because I'd have uninterrupted time for coding. I haven’t done as much coding as I’d liked to have done. I’ve finished 40% of Python at CodeAcademy. There are lots of distractions at home, and our family has been having going through unemployment ($30,000 past yearly income for a family of four), so it got hard to fit coding in between homework, the stress of  my dad’s unemployment, everyone being home, and longer days because of sports.
","I'm interested in software, hardware, and game development. They're interesting to me because I can use drawing, photography and my passion for cars as a game developer and make the next big racing game.

Would I want to put the car together, or would I want to design the car and its parts? I want to be the one who designs the car because I can draw and code. I'd also be able to develop the car's software and decide what it should be made out of.
","Since my sister is attending UPenn, and my mentor graduated from there, I would also want to go there too. I'd study Computer science and art. I'd choose those because I could use computer science to land a job at Microsoft, Activision or Turn 10 Studios. The only problem would be my habit of procrastination, general loss of interest, and if a subject seemed too easy. To solve these problems, I’d redo assignments that I'd missed or had done poorly, repeat concepts that I'd learned and try new things in the subject I'd be studying to maintain a steady interest.
","Over the summer, I did lots of drawing and practiced my photography skills. To practice drawing I drew a couple of Deadpool pieces, and a 3d Formula 1 car. To practice photography, I went to the Philadelphia Auto Show and took pictures. These are important to me because they are both things that I can express what I was feeling when I drew, and shot. I also did on and off coding with Python at CodeAcademy. Coding’s important to me because I can design cars and work on video games. If I was a game developer I'd be able to draw and code at the same time.
","During middle school math was really hard for me. I came straight out of homeschooling and didn't understand any of the lessons that were being taught by the teachers. Since I wasn't understanding the lessons, I had to do special classes aside from the rest of the class. To help solve my problem, I started going to afterschool tutoring, made myself prepare more for tests, and asked my classmates and siblings for help. As a result, my tests grades went up, my grade changed from a C to a B+, turned homework in on time, I was no longer confused, and the lessons seemed easier than before.
","I like working alone because it allows me to get some tasks done quicker than others, and I can sometimes come up with good ideas when uninterrupted. On the other hand, working in a team allows you to get stuff checked over by other teammates instead of one person. You also learn to ask for help from your teammates, and that they will filter good/bad ideas as a group. My cross country team, up to our last meet, practiced alot. We ran 4 miles instead of 5K's, and did lots of conditioning. When I tried preparing for meets alone, I couldn't go as far as I could when I was with a group. I learned that teamwork is valuable because you have peers that you can look up to for help.

It is something that I have never done before, but it is something that I think I would enjoy. Also, I want to do something over the summer that is not only fun, but also enriching to keep my mind sharp over the summer. This program would help me broaden my options to figure out what I would like to do in the future. Right now, I don’t really know what I want to do, but hopefully, this program would help me to identify computer programming as something that would interest me in the future.","The thing that excites me the most about technology is the fact that it is forever changing and improving to meet our everyday needs. If we look at the releases of the galaxy smart phones as an example, every year the phone is improved to run faster, better, and more efficiently than the previous models. This shows that technology would keep on improving in the future to meet the needs and interests of that particular time. Without technology, there would be a whole lot of stuff that we wouldn’t be capable of doing, which is why technology is really interesting. I am interested in the production of mobile apps. It is something that has always fascinated me, but it is something that I have never tried before.  ","My ideal college is Harvard University. It’s a college that I have always dreamed of going to. I don’t really know a lot about the school, but I do know that with hard work I can get myself there. If I were to attend Harvard, I think that I would probably want to study chemistry, or maybe even computer programming if this program convinces me that programming is my passion. There are many obstacles that could prevent me from going to Harvard. One could be the low admissions rate that Harvard has which is at 6%. This would mean that there is a lot of competition to get into this school. Another obstacle that I may face may be the quality of choices that I make. For example, if I choose to procrastinate instead of taking care of the work I have to do, then this could affect my grades and in the long run determine if I would get accepted into Harvard.","Last summer, I did volunteer work at New York Presbyterian at the Weill Cornell Campus in the Upper East Side in Manhattan. I worked in the food and nutrition department, which was in charge of taking the patients’ orders, serving the patients, and making sure that the patients got the correct foods that corresponded with their specific diets that were prescribed by their doctors. I went around and helped out most of the food servers all over the hospital. This experience was important to me because it exposed me to people who are less fortunate than us physically and psychologically. I was able to meet and talk to people about their lives and learn about their physical misfortunes. This experience helped me to see how fortunate we all are since we are all healthy and well. Most of the patients gave me advice on life which I will definitely keep dear to my heart for a long time.","The last time that I was challenged with something in school was back in freshman year I’m my math class. Before high school, I was very good at math and comfortable doing almost any kind of question. When I came to Bronx Science, I had to take geometry as my freshman year math class. I thought that it would be easy because I only thought of geometry as the kind of math that dealt with shapes. That honestly wasn’t the case. We started the math year doing something called proofs and I literally had no clue as to what I was doing for the first part of the year.  I had failed the first two math tests and quizzes of the year and at that time I really was about to give up, but something was telling me that I shouldn’t start my high school experience on the wrong note. So I worked really hard and studied my body out that I was able to raise my geometry average from a 66% to an 86% between November and January of the first term. During the second term, I wanted to keep this momentum going, so I continued pressing and studying to come out with a final grade of a 95% in geometry.","I prefer working by myself rather than working in a group. From my experiences in working in groups, sometimes everything works out, but other times group work can be a disaster. Sometimes, people wouldn’t start their part of the project until a few hours before the project is due. This would then cause a lot of chaos and would make all of us in the group stay up all night trying to finish up. Working by myself allows me to start any project at any time without feeling rushed. Also, working by myself allows me to be accountable for all aspects of the project and lets me be in control of everything. If something ends up being wrong with the project or anything that has to deal with it, then I would have only myself to blame, rather than blaming others.",6,Yes,tagoej@bxscience.edu,242387093,tagoej@bxscience.edu,Joshua Tagoe,Joshua Tagoe,,,1,Joshua Tagoe,Google,4,7,4,JZ Celebrity Basketball,"HTML, CSS, JS","Focus, motivation",Game Dev.,,Focus,Tech,Neutral,0

Having previously taking a coding class in an after school program, I knew I wanted to get better at it. Coding also is great for my future endeavors, because I want to pursue a college major in computer science, and it will be helpful to have coding experience when I apply for college. I am particularly interested in learning how to write code for computer games. I'm also excited at the prospect of meeting other people who are interested in coding, gaming, and computers and having the opportunity to meet people who work in tech. I love the statement by founder Christina Lewis Halpern, in which she states she is devoted to providing young men of color with opportunities in the tech industries. As an African American, I would be proud and honored to participate in this program. ","The aspect of technology that thrills me the most is the design of video games. I have been a avid video game fan since I was young and my ambition is to learn how to design and write code for video games. Another aspect of technology I'm interested in is creating products that will help improve the quality of everyday life for people around the world, while also saving the environment. I am convinced that there must be technology that could effectively recycle all the stuff we currently throw away, and I would like to be involved in designing cars and other transportation that doesn’t use fuels that pollute our planet.
","If money were no object, I would love to go to MIT or CalTech to study computer science. I have done extensive research on where the best programs in computer science are and these are always among the top ten. A major obstacle to being admitted to these programs is getting sufficient practical experience in code. I know that in order to get into college, you have to demonstrate that you are well-rounded. Getting into this program will help me considerably in this pursuit. Other obstacles include not having the connections to members of the tech industry who might be able to advise me on the best path to take and I am very hopeful that I will meet some mentors in All Star Code.","Last summer, I participated in the Fulbright Junior Internship Program in South Korea. I experienced many new things such as travelling on plane by myself and being a leader to campers. It was significant to me because I had to go through a rigorous application process in order to be accepted to the program, including doing an interview. While I was there, I participated in helping the students with English, and setting up fun activities for the students to partake in. I loved getting to know Korean culture and having the chance to practice my Korean vocabulary. I also gained confidence in myself because I was far away from home and managed to adapt very well to my new surroundings and quickly made new friends. ","I am and have been struggling with my writing ""Modes"" project. A modes project includes 4-5 different essays about one topic, including extensive research on them. My topic is about the effects of capitalism and communism on their respective societies. Although I got good grades on them, the amount of time and effort I have had to put into these projects has been disproportionate. Writing is a subject that has never come easily; I’ve always had trouble putting my thoughts to paper. I've improved considerably over the years, however. I don't think I'll ever particularly enjoy it, but it has been rewarding to see my grades go up as a result of my hard work and effort.","I prefer to work with a team because I believe that 'teamwork makes the dream work.' I think collaborating can be fun and I also find myself being more productive when working with others. I recently read an article about swarm intelligence, in which the author wrote about how creativity grows in 'swarms', or teams. I believe that ideas can be sparked by being with others. Finally, working in teams can be motivating, because you get feedback and encouragement from your teammates, which can spur you on and make you work harder.

I need to hone my skills as a coder and make lasting connections in the field of technology and what better way to do that than through All Star Code. I’ve tried my hand at Ruby, and I’ve hit a few roadblocks. I know that All Star Code is going to help me understand the things that I’m not too sure of and the things that I don’t even know exist. It’s an understatement when I say that it’s the perfect opportunity for me this summer.
","I like how things interact, how technologies communicate, and the “internet of things”.  I want to know how exactly computers talk to each other that aren’t directly connected by wires. How do a few million transistors interpret data in a processor to present it on a computer screen? How do we interact with that data? How does an interpreter literally interpret human language and convert it into a machine-readable language on the fly? How do our phones analyze our speech patterns and convert what we say into text? These are all questions I have that I know that just looking them up online won’t give me the in-depth answer I’m looking for. I’m especially interested in the internet of things. Mostly, though, I’m interested in quantum computing and how that could play a part in the creation of holograms that could be used as a means of communication.","My dream school is the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. I’ve wanted to go to that school ever since I went to Boston, where I was born, for MIT SPLASH 2015. I hear of so many success stories from that school like Sal Khan with Khan Academy, a platform which I used to use extensively, less now but I still do, or Imogen Heap and her magical musical gloves which she created at MIT. I’d like to emulate that success. I would like to study software engineering, but I’d sprinkle a little music here and there and some physics, too. I want to do something with music, I don’t know what yet but I feel that I can combine music with coding to make something unique. Getting into MIT might be a little difficult because of my grades ( I had a 2.8 in 9th grade and a 3.8 in 10th grade) but there is still a chance to be accepted. I’ll try as hard as possible to get my GPA as close to a 4.0 as possible. As for combining music with coding, that can be done at any college. However, the difficulty comes when making two seemingly disparate things become one. ","Last summer, I took piano lessons. I love electronic dance music. In fact, I like it so much that I’ve decided to start making it my own music. Before last summer, I thought, “ Wouldn’t knowing how to play a real instrument, especially the piano, help me a lot when making my music?” I asked around one day after school and found out that I could take piano lessons with one of my teacher’s relatives next summer and that my school would pay for those lessons. Taking piano lessons has helped me a lot in terms of making my own music. Because of these lessons, I learned the fundamentals of music theory. Piano lessons opened a door for me that was previously closed and helped me expand my knowledge into an area of life which to me was previously unreachable.  ","Not too long ago, I was trying to make a Ruby application for my school. I thought it’d be cool if the school hosted it’s own blog and newspaper. I diligently started training myself in the art that is Ruby on Codecademy while using various other sources as pointers. I got through that stage and decided to start making my own web application. I asked my friends if they had any experience with Ruby and one of them told me that they used the online IDE called Cloud9. I began using it but I didn’t really understand it. I decided to ask for help. Luckily, that week was the week that my school planned a trip to MIT SPLASH 2015. At MIT. There, I decided to ask for help from one of my instructors in a Python programming class. He taught me about Linux and how useful it is. I decided work offline from that point on. For a few months afterwards, I was working on my project on my personal computer, watching youtube videos to help me make my school web application. Somewhere along the road, I hit a roadblock. I couldn’t make a destroy function for the blog. I tried everything but everything I did was useless. I just couldn’t figure it out. Then I decided to ask for more help around my school. That’s when one of my teachers decided to call one of her friends who works at teachable.com. He now teaches a coding club at our school and is helping me finish the school blog and newspaper. "," Even though I don’t oppose working in a team of individuals striving towards the same goal, I’d rather work solo because I think that on my own I can get more quality work done more efficiently. I know my own strengths and weaknesses and while working in a group, I’d have to account for the strengths and weaknesses of others.  There’d be a lot of communication and the sharing of opinions, which leads, at times, to disagreements which can bog down the progress of a group towards their objective. Besides, it’s exciting to figure things out on one’s own.  Nevertheless, as I stated before, I am not opposed to working in a team. In some cases, there is no other option than to work together because everyone has had different prior experiences and knows different things. Everyone has the ability to bring something unique to the table when working together, such as new perspectives or angles which if I had worked alone I might not have seen myself. I’d prefer to work solo, but if the need arises I’m able to work as part of a team.

The use of technology not only excites me but leaves me with many questions that I believe will be answered in the program.The program also appeals directly to my affiliation with computer science over an other subject area. I plan on becoming a computer programmer in the future and feel that this program would be a good step toward my goal as well as enables me to keep this dream of mine as a tangible reality. I am also very excited to come to know our mentors and leaders of the program and have a reliable network of peers both rookie and veteran to aid me on my path to triumph. Secondly, when I first saw the email about the program I sincerely believed it was a perfect program to try and get into for the sake of my future career and my college decisions. The earlier I can network many trustworthy mentors and friends, the earlier I can be of help and importance to others. With all the work I have to accomplish before the college process begins over the summer, I would like to use the program as a means to enjoy the summer yet stay productive while simultaneously boosting my resume.","What excites me about technology comes two fold, the technology itself , meaning how it functions and how I can come to replicate it and better it, and the aspect of the industry of technology. When I say the industry I mean marketing and performing tasks suited towards others. I am also interested in tinkerers; a couple months ago I saw an advertisement on YouTube about the creator of 5 hour energy ,Manoj Bhargava, and how he dedicates his wealth and time to use technology to help people all around the world. Prior to this I only thought of technology as cell phones, televisions, and things of the sort. However, now I know how amazing technology really is and how it can do so much good to a lot of people by dedicating yourself to the line of duty that is programming and tinkering.
The areas that interest me the most in technology is the creative aspect of programming above all else. I have recently joined a club on my own volition which teaches java and python in which I have come to love bug fixing because I tend to make a few mistakes here and there but in the end. A finished working code actually excites me and allows me to bug fix my other projects much faster as I know where my mistakes lie.","If money were no object I would love to go to either NYU or Columbia University. More so, Columbia University because of the location, the areas of study, and the fact I believe that Columbia University would push me to become a great and prosperous adult, while allowing me to grow and see the state that I grew up in in its best light. I would take as many Computer science, as well as engineering classes I could possibly take. Solely for the reason, that with technology, you can not know too much. Becoming a computer scientist that understands engineering would be very advantageous for me, and would allow me to start my own projects that would eventually change my position as employee to employer in the future. New York is one of the most technologically advanced cities on the planet, so becoming educated in the field here only makes sense. However, a small part of me wants to experience more in life, and this curiosity of what's out there pushes me away from these high demand colleges that my heart and brain tell me is the best place for me to go. If the curiosity had ever won over my reason I would probably try to go to Stanford university to see a change of pace further on in my educational career. At the moment I am dead set on a New York school that supplies an active campus life, a lot of areas of study that will pique my interest and keep me on the track to success.","Last summer was a particularly slow summer, only to my own fault I may add. However in the later half of the summer, end of June and throughout August, I had entered a church group program that educates both youths such as myself and children about becoming an important part of the community. I remember meeting a young boy by the name of Chris that lived a couple block away from me that wanted to play basketball,  play drums, sing, and cook. His ambition to do everything pushed me to match his energy level and go above him to be a respectable teen in his eyes. We have since become very good friends, and he won’t hesitate to ask for whatever, whenever he needs to. I have since changed my attitude on how I should present myself amongst others, and learned optimism is a deadly force to reckon with. Prior to meeting Chris I was labeled as the shy guy and allowed my shy behavior to hinder my progress in making friends, doing group work, and taking full advantage of my school's extracurricular activities including the computer science club where I work with others to complete a given task. Towards the last few weeks of the Summer I took the initiative to hang out with some friends of school where we made memories bowling in Brooklyn, taking advantage of living next to the beach, and making head way on the remainder of our homework.","I haven’t really struggled in school in the traditional sense, or assignments for class, but I remember a single experience that forced me to make changes or ultimately fail. I was working on a group project all by myself because I was reluctant to choose a group I was stuck with a group of people who had no interest in doing the work. I was too shy to talk to them and convince them to help me with out project so I ended up trying to take on the project by myself. In hindsight, it wasn’t as difficult as I had deemed it back then, but it was like rocket science to me. The task was to complete a video, slideshow, and research paper on how meat can be preserved without using modern technology. This required a lot of research and more so a lot of effort and time. The problem was, I needed to delegate the responsibility of creating the slideshow and a portion of the video to my group members so I can concentrate on making a really good research paper. Eventually, I solved my problem about a week before the assignment was due and showed them all the progress I had made, which was a large portion of the slideshow and research paper done. They saw that mass amount of work done and the work left and to my surprise volunteered to do the rest of the work. This is where I learned to speak up for myself and communicate my problems to the people who can actually help solve my problem. In the end, we had gotten a well deserved 102 on the assignment and a special mention in class.","I prefer to work as part of a team now, mainly because I honestly like the idea of having work split up and having each of us specialize in one aspect of a huge task making something that seemed impossible to do, reasonable. There are scenarios that I would like to have some time to work and figure things out for my own benefit ofcourse, but I am open to both criticism and praise of my work. I believe in success versus believing in winning, as winning is too lonely of a word in comparison to success. As a team we can succeed and push past one another barriers and faults to make an amazing product and complete a vigorous task. While winning gives off a feel of a moment of success. A satisfying project well done within a group guarantees accountability and fine work. Working solo in entirety would only accumulate stress, and every kink in completing the goal would only further decay one’s idea of a completed task. In the past year I have also learned that group work is ideal in almost any scenario, and specialized labor could make any task into a small one. If anything, I would rather over see my peers and have my peers over see my actions as time is money. If we can get a job done perfectly in 2 days, on o 10 day hard deadline, we should  aim to complete our task in 3 days and see if we can make it any better in the next 7 days.",5,Yes,Keroneb@scholarsnyc.com,237359161,keroneb@scholarsnyc.com,,,,,0,Kerone Brown,Goldman Sachs,3,7,3,Ocular Dare,"Focused, HTML, CSS, JS",Quiet,"Will continue to ""Dare Greatly""",,Quiet,Neutral,Tech,0

It's amazing how a person can do anything with a computer. It's also amazing how the processor can do anything someone makes it do. The areas I am interested in are computer engineering, computer system security, and cyber forensics.",If money were no object I would go to Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburg because it is known for a technical school and it offers more majors in the computer field.

","There was a time when I had to write an essay about myself in middle school. I had to describe my myself, my interests and what I wanted to do in life. The challenging thing about this project was that I didn't know what to write about. It was almost like I didn't know myself. I didn't know what my life will be like after I graduated middle school or how college would look like and what will I do. I resolved this challenge by writing out what I do throughout the week and I chose what I actually like doing throughout the week. I also asked my cousin, since she was in college, how was life like and what did she do to succeed and have high grades in college.

I believe that All Star Code can give me this education that is necessary when one considers a career in tech, and would be a valuable life experience to enroll in this program. I know that this program will give me the skills and learning experience that I need to learn various types of code, as well as give me the experience with big tech companies that one would need when considering various job opportunities. Not only that, but I think that attending this program would just be a fun experience overall to do.It is both fantastically interesting, as well as free of charge, which, in my book, can never be a bad combination. Not only that, but this program would be a great experience for me to know what to expect when I reach college level course work, as the fast paced and intensive workload mirrors very accurately what it’s like majoring in any tech related subject. Lastly, it would allow me to explore my interests in computer science, and give me insight in one of my favorite passions and pastimes. Therefore, I would like to enroll not only in order to receive a holistic and invaluable education in computer programming, but as well as to explore the tech world and have fun while doing it.
","Technology in general has always sparked an interest in me. Ever since I was little, I had always loved technology. I think i was born in this time period only because everything about our increasingly modernizing and technologically fast paced world fascinates me. i remember when I was a small child looking at my toy cars, and smashing them open just to see what made them work (I was a tad robust in my efforts). One of my most serious passions is developing tech and virtual reality. I have an extreme passion behind the tech of Virtual Reality, and enjoy watching the VR videos on Youtube with my homemade set of goggles. It just fascinates me so much the way we can make something so two dimensional come to life right in front of us. I also find great interest in developing technology, such as glass tech (i.e. see through phones, holographic screens and keyboards, etc.). Developing tech had always sparked an interest in me due to the fact that it was like watching the future come into reality today. One great example of my vision is the Disney movie Big Hero 6. I remember walking out of that theatre knowing that tech was where it’s at, due to the fact that all these technologies that so many would think are ages away from being developed, are actually in existence at the moment. I love the idea of seeing the future come into reality, and because of that I love tech, as it can always make that possible.
","If I could study anything, i would have to be either computer science/computer engineering or animation. Computers and drawing are two of my favorite passions in the world. they connect so seamlessly, and because of that I can relate both passions to each other. If you could find me a college that connect both together in such a way that i could double major in both subjects, I would apply in a blink of the eye. I would hope to do this at Stanford University, or NYU. Both of these colleges are basically my dream schools,and If I can get into both of these places and study Animation and Computer Science, then my life would be complete (especially if it’s for free). There are many obstacles which would prevent me from achieving this. one wou;d be the fact that any schools implement a quota system, and once a quota of that specific minority group or social profile is filled, they would no longer accept students of that type. Another issue that afflicts me is financing. It’s incredibly hard to receive financial aid from most colleges, and because of the increasing tuition rates across the country, I probably couldn’t go to college across the country. Another obstacle which would afflict me is the fact that the majority of the tech industry favors white applicants rather than minority applicants, so I’m less likely to find a job in that aspect. Therefore, although it would be great to study what I want, i’d be at a great disadvantage when it came to applying for college and work.","One certain activity that was very important to me from last summer was reading the full harry potter series, from start to finish. As bad as it may sound, I had never actually fully read each harry potter book from start to finish, Sure, i tried reading it back in Elementary school but I would always skip a few pages to find out what would happen, skipping all the action. Therefore, to me it was a personal task and job to finally read the entirety of the series, from page one of the first book, the last page of the last book. THis was important to me because I wanted to validare to myself the idea that i am always capable of doing anything, no matter what the task. And, clearly, during the summer I don’t think anyone wants to be cooped up reading all day. THat’s why it was extremely important to me to finish the whole series. I wanted to prove to myself that i could do anything. I wanted to show myself that If i can put my mind to it, it can be accomplished. you could say that the experience was a way to build both my self esteem as well as my confidence in my capabilities. THe task itself seems to be mundane, and frankly, uninteresting, but to me it was imperative that i got through the books, because if I couldn't, then that would go against my thinking and my belief that anything is possible if you put your mind to it.","i remember one time back in my ninth grade physics class when I couldn’t really fully understand the unit of electricity and magnetism. I tried countless practice problems, but I still couldn’t get it. The night before the test on the unit, I was feeling hopeless. But, I remembered a word of advice my mother always gave me. “Life is like a heartbeat on a heart monitor; it goes up and down. You’re never going to always be on the top, and never always on the bottom. At the bottoms you gotta keep going until you get to the top again”. So, instead of feeling bad for myself and wondering how I was going to pass this test, I started looking at it from a real world perspective, how I could apply this unit to my everyday life. I took the test and aced it. It’s in my nature to always push and persevere through the difficulties of learning something new. Whether it be the basics of electricity, a really hard math problem, or maybe even just how to roller skate, I would never back down from the challenge. Some may call it hopeless to keep trying to understand something, but I just see it as a new opportunity to show that it can be done.","Although working solo may seem appetizing, it’s always better to work in a team. the reason why i would prefer working in a team rather than by myself is simply because there’s a higher chance the work we produce will be a prime product of collaboration. When someone works by themselves, they can’t get input from anyone else on whether what they made is good or not, or if it needs more work. Most would simply think that their work is good without even considering getting advice from someone else. In a team on the other hand, you can get a different perspective on a project, which will get more scrutiny as there are multiple people looking at the project and giving it criticism. For example,let’s say you have a piece of artwork, a flower that looks more like an upside down monkey. You, the artist will think it’s the best, but others who do not have this bias will know that that looks nothing like a flower. Not Only that, but work in group allows for a project to be turned out quicker, as you get more hands working on the same project. therefore, working groups would not only help turn out the project at a quicker rate, but it also helps to have multiple points of views and input that would allow the project to be at it’s best, as when multiple points of view will be more critical toward a project and help you polish it rather than when you work by yourself and get no other input, thinking that your project is at it’s best, when in reality it might not even be that great.",6,Yes,kevincalderon@scholarsnyc.com,239203259,kevincalderon@scholarsnyc.com,,,,,1,Kevin Calderon,Alley,3,8,8,Gen-Z,"HTML, CSS, JS, Firebase, charisma",Teamwork,Tech work for non-profit,V. outgoing and friendly,Loner,Tech,Tech,1

I’ve taken an interest in the computer languages that make up everything we see online, and I would love to know how they work, in order to create things that will have a positive impact on the world. This great opportunity will help to not only make amazing new friends with other guys boasting similar interests as mine, but also to establish important connections that will last for the rest of my life. ","The thing that really excites me about technology is that it’s gaining an increasingly important role in our future. It is rapidly improving, as seen by it’s growth over the past couple decades. For example, computers have shrank from the size of a building back then to the size of the cell phone now, and yet grew increasingly more powerful in the process. In addition, technology has also become part of our daily lives, with additions such as the TV and the home computer, as well as the laptop and phone – all being improved upon as we speak! I’m interested in a lot of areas when it comes to technology, although the main thing that comes to mind are building and programming robots, amongst the many other creative things you can do with technology and coding at your disposal. Robots are hopping the barrier between science fiction and reality, and it’d be great to see how much they can help the human race achieve new heights. They’ve already helped quite a lot, from making factory jobs easier to exploring Mars. Who knows what else they can do in the near future?","If money was not an object, I’d immediately go study at a good college that specializes in math and science, preferably the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or MIT for short. MIT is a leading school when it comes to technology, even against other schools with a similar focus. I would pursue math and science there, but I’d also take a dive at engineering since it combines math, science, and art together. I can find myself inventing and engineering robots to help humans take on particularly laborious tasks, such as construction work or fighting diseases or even solving some of the world’s biggest problems. The biggest obstacle for me to conquer is actually getting accepted into the school itself, as I am aware that it is very competitive and selective when it comes to enrolling students.","Last summer I spent 6 weeks at a camp in New Hampshire known as the Wolfeboro School. For the most part, the weekdays usually consisted of both classes in the morning as well as camp activities in the afternoon. On weekends, the entire school went outside the camp grounds for activities, such as going to the movies. I experienced the benefits of a structured schedule with minor distractions, and I performed very well there as a result. I focused on my work and attempted to improve my social life by making new friends. This experience was an important one because I was able to learn more about myself there, as well as educate and entertain myself at the same time.","A couple of years ago, I embarked on a 14-month program that prepared top students from all over NYC to attend boarding school, known as Prep for Prep 9. A group of about 70-80 students started the program with me, and it was extremely tough to even get through the first 2 months. The workload was unlike anything I’ve ever experienced before, with mountains of especially challenging homework to get through in a single night. Quite a few people began to drop out either willingly or simply due to not preforming well enough. I was always on the chopping block, as I was constantly getting less than average grades, at the expense of losing countless upon countless hours of sleep. However, I persevered through it all by eventually seeking help, especially from my father, who was willing to endure these trials with me. I eventually graduated and was able to get accepted into a private school, where the workload was much easier, thanks to the preparation I received from the Prep 9 program.","I prefer to work alone. This is mainly because I haven’t had enough opportunities to work on a team while I was at school. Whenever I do get put on a team, it usually contains part of a group of friends who take full helm of the project that needs to be done, and I usually just fade into the distance, either having a minor role or nothing to do at all. In addition, my vision for how a project should look like usually gets sidelined in favor of other visions. I don’t have that problem when I work alone. I wouldn’t mind working in a team, however, because I see the benefits of being on a team instead of just going solo. One person in a team can toss a project idea out, and everyone else can talk about the flaws and benefits, adjusting the idea to make it better. Teams are also a way to build solid relationships with new people, as well as to make a couple of new friends along the way. I wouldn’t mind working on a team for these reasons.",6,Yes,,239445453,kevinprempeh@gmail.com,,,,,1,Kevin Prempeh,MLB,1,7,3,EmAlert,"strong CS skills, focused","Loner, lack of confidence, overly focused to the point he would not be with the rest of the class","Engineering Degree, Game Dev.",Struggled to stay focused and felt lonely most of the time.,Loner,Non-Tech,Tech,0

I feel All Star Code will benefit me in the long run and give me something valuable and fun to do over the long summer break from school. In addition to my interests for participating in All Star Code, I would love to meet new people who share the same passion as me when exposed to software engineering. The idea of not only learning how to be an entrepreneur, but sharing and combining ideas with others while learning sounds soothing and gets me excited to be a part of your program.","The thing that really excites me about technology is the gaming area of it. The concept of building totally different worlds for others to roam in and experience is mind blowing and unique. Growing up and throughout my childhood I have always been exposed to video games and loved it. No matter what game it was or how people viewed them; that being people say they are pointless or violent, I seen them differently. I see them as a new opportunity, a new you, to escape reality and be someone else ranging from a soldier in the military to a NBA superstar. The endless possibilities of things you can create in a virtual world really gets me excited and thrilled to learn about this area. ","If I could go to any college in the world, I would go to Stony Brook University and study around the field of computer science. I would go here because this is my dream college. Researching about its campus and its environment all connects with me in a way, such that it sounds like a perfect fit for me. I have also heard that Stony Brook has good computer science programs and classes that I would be interested in participating if I could. To me, the opportunity of learning something new everyday gives me hope that I can better the future by creating things for others to enjoy with the knowledge I have obtained. The obstacles that may prevent me from achieving this dream is Stony Brooks location from New York City and of course the high scores and grades you need to get in. These obstacles may be rough for me but I know that with enough hard work and dedication you can achieve anything. I hope All Star Code can be apart of my hard work into bettering myself  by learning more and more about computer science and many more skills. ","Unfortunately, last summer as far as jobs and camps go, I haven't really done much. A lot of my summer time was spent with family and friends, bonding through several activities. These activities vary from competitive sport playing to knocking down pins in the bowling alley. Although I value the bonding experience these events brought me and my family, I really want to start educating myself further for my future career. I feel like All Star Code is a great place to start my summer learning and will be a key role into keeping my mind sharp and active during the long summer break. ","A time I struggled with something would be now actually. This year in my school enrolled me into three advanced placement college classes in high school. These classes being AP chemistry, AP Computer Science, and AP Language and Composition. Sophomore year compared to junior year was a cruise. Now I am overloaded with work and new material from each of my classes and couldn't take it, almost to the point where I was considering dropping out of one of them. However, before I made any rash decisions, I sought out guidance from a teacher and learned about all the benefits these classes could possibly provide for me. This gave me the spark I needed. Knowing these classes could change the outcome of what college I go to or how people at job interviews would view me, I made a lot of changes to my daily habits and routines. Instead of going home everyday after school and fooling around I would take out my notes from school and study constantly to keep up with the material. I even sacrificed time with friends to overcome this overload of work from three AP classes, so I can be in a comfortable position and better myself for the future. ","If I had to pick between working solo or part of a team I would chose a team. The great thing about being a part of a team is I am never alone. Never alone when it comes to sharing my ideas with someone or learning new things. The reasons I love being a part and working as a team is because I can learn so much off another classmate or even teach someone that needs a little more support. Also, the thing with working as a team than an individual is you can get more done in a shorter amount of time. Working with others to break down complex problems is also a more smarter and efficient way to work because not one person is strained with a problem and can collaborate with others to solve it.",4,Yes,kobed2241@afsenyc.org,242412330,kobed2241@afsenyc.org,,Kobe DeJesus,,,0,Kobe DeJesus ,Goldman Sachs,3,7,2,PacMane,"HTML, CSS, JS, teamwork",Difficulty expressing himself verbally,CS degree at Stony Brook,,,Tech,Tech,1

Unfortunately, minority involvement in CS at my school is sparse, and it doesn’t offer any opportunities at immersion in CS, restricting my exploration strictly to the classroom. When I moved from Jordan around four years ago, I was faced with a world of a whole new language. I had experience speaking English before, but I was finally in a situation where I could practice and utilize my knowledge. Similarly, I’ve had exposure to another “foreign language” — Java! I crave the opportunity to be able to put my knowledge to use, and to develop my skill to the level of fluency. Therefore, upon learning about the All Star Code Summer Intensive, I was beyond ecstatic to have the opportunity to explore real-life applications of CS, and learn to code in different languages. Moreover, having a sister that participated in a similar coding program, I found that All Star Code would be the perfect opportunity to learn more, and to meet with young men who come from a minority background, such as myself.","The fact that technology offers a completely new world to explore excites me greatly. I am very interested in computer software such as program developing and coding. I find it simply amazing that computers comprehend a whole different language. I would want to further explore the science behind how computers know what each command represents and how binary came to be. I am also fascinated by computer hardware including motherboards, monitors, keyboards, and other parts of the computer. The fact that a screen so thin can represent so many colors and complex shapes mesmerizes me. The world of technology is a mystery that I greatly look forward to exploring.","If money was not an issue, I would attend the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, since it’s my dream college. I would study subjects ranging from neuropsychology to computer science and coding. I am very interested in discovering how things work, and both of those fields explain very similar but very different worlds— those worlds being the human mind and the depths of a computer’s programming. Some obstacles that might be preventing me from achieving my dream include MIT’s strict admissions process and the complexity of the fields I am interested in. As of 2014, MIT has had an acceptance rate of 7.9%, which is very low and makes the university very challenging to get accepted into. To overcome this obstacle I will have to work especially hard on my schoolwork and put a lot of thought into my application. Although these are tough obstacles, I do not believe that they are impossible.","Both my parents are unable to travel due to their immigration status, and as a result, this summer I was the only one able to travel to Jordan, the country I grew up in. The purpose of my trip was to spend some time taking care of my grandmother, who has been diagnosed with Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases. The trip was very important to me because, growing up, my grandmother constantly took care of me while my mom was at work. I was devastated to hear she was getting really sick, and even worse, that I couldn’t even be around her. Whenever I wanted something, she would go out of her way to make sure my needs were fulfilled. When I needed a new pair of shoes, or when I was craving her delicious breakfast arrangements, she’d drop everything to put a smile on my face. The tables had turned, and I wanted to return the favor and be there for her. Therefore, when my parents told me that I had the chance to travel back and take care of her, I was ecstatic. I spent my summer giving back to the woman who made my childhood a dream, and I hope that having me around her helped her feel loved and taken care of in her sick days.","This year, I decided to take an elective subject: the Independent Learners’ Program. Through this program, I was hoping to take my guitar self-learning experience to a higher level. I had taught myself the basics of guitar without help from a professional instructor, and therefore, during the weekly meetings with my mentor, I struggled with explaining the steps through which I was teaching myself, and constructing a presentation on my learning experience. In the beginning I felt that it was not possible to describe what I had been working on for over a year. The ideas that were so vivid in my mind were not playing out the way I wanted them to on paper, leaving me frustrated. However, as I attempted my task, I found that these practices came naturally to me. Attempting to write about something I loved gave me inspiration to work on myself, and taught me how to present my ideas in the correct manner. Before long, I noticed that it turned out to be quite rewarding. It gave my guitar learning experience a whole new facet that challenged and excited me, and now, I am happy to have achieved what appeared to be impossible at first.","Throughout my experiences, I have noticed that I have my strengths while working solo as well as part of a team. Working solo is much less stressful, for it gives me the freedom to capitalize on all of my ideas, with all of the artistic freedom I wanted. I love the rush of channelling myself through my work, which is an element that can easily get overlooked in a large team effort. When I am left alone to work, I find myself able to explore my mind and come up with my own ideas and be able to implement them in my work. Moreover, I’ve found it to be smoother when compared to group work, which requires a lot of coordination and a high level of communication. However, I am always willing to work as part of a team, for I love the aspect of collaboration and learning from one another. When working with a team, I’ve found that I am capable of compromising more and opening my mind up to other people’s way of thinking. This has helped me improve my social skills and demonstrate my determination to create a project representative of each individual member’s vision.",6,Yes,mahmouddaas@yahoo.co.uk,241305768,mahmouddaas@yahoo.co.uk,,Mahmoud Daas,,,1,Mahmoud Daas,Goldman Sachs,0,7,8,Next Generation Employment,"Insightful, HTML, CSS, JS",,Will be successful no matter his focus,,,Neutral,Tech,0

I am very fascinated by those apps like how two people who are 1000 miles away from each other can see each other on live and see whatever each other doing like he is in front of your eyes, that’s very cool. I really want to know how did they do that. That’s why I’m really excited to do computer science and learn how those apps are capable to do that and one day maybe create my own app.","I would like to study Computer Science in Massachusset Institute of Technology (MIT)
because I heard people saying is a good university for computer science and people who study there are been successful in their live like Sal Khan. Sal Khan is a big inspiration for me with his website Khan Academy where you can learn many subject in many different languages.
The obstacles which might prevent me from achieving that dream is because I’m undocumented and English is my second language, so it’s going to be hard for me to meet their admission requirement like the SAT score they are asking.","Last summer I did a program call Summer Intensive English Language Program (SIELP) at Hostos Community College in the Bronx. It’s a program design for high school student for whom english is their second language. It’s a program where they taught us grammar, conjugation, and the fundamental skill for how to write an outstanding essay. We also read two novels about U.S history especially about American Revolution. Every friday we had a field trip in the New York City area. We visited for example Fraunces Tavern, Governor Island, and others places.
This program was important for me because I been in the U.S only seven months when I joined the program and during the school year it was hard for me to understand what my teachers was saying in english so I said to myself I need a program where I can learn more english during the summer before the next school year. So this program really helps me to improve my english and be ready for the next school year.","One day I struggled with a math problem, it was hard for me to find the solution but I was sure I can do it. When I got home I start solving the problem but every time I got stuck in the same part. I checked my notes, my math book and the step I used was the same as in my notes and the math book but still I can’t find the solution. Then I showed  my friend and ask for his opinion and he showed me where I was wrong.  I was missing a small little thing and when he showed me that I feel like “why I didn’t see that”.","I prefer working as part of a team because if I don’t understand or struggling in something I can ask my team mates or if I’m working on the project I can finish it faster with a team than solo and in a team everybody have a different idea which can be put together to build something big.

I would love to be in an environment that fosters the exposure of young men like myself in computer science careers, which are currently in demand. My family can not financially afford such a program.","What excites me about technology is how it betters humanity by improving people lives. Advancement in the field of medicine, communication, the spread of information worldwide, advancing business transactions and processes are possible because of technology. I am interested in the areas of software development and gaming. For example creating apps for mobile devices, developing games for computers or game consoles, and creating software for computers.","If money wasn’t an option, I will go to MIT in MA and study computer science. MIT is consider one of the top colleges in the US to study Computer science. I believe there will be world class professors, countless research and internship opportunities.  What is preventing me from going there is that financially my parents cannot afford it.","Last summer I had the opportunity to travel with a Christian Youth Group from Philadelphia to Hancock County, Tennessee. Our project was to build a deck for a low income family. Our project was accomplished during our stay there. This service project was important to me because I usually volunteer in my neighborhood but I felt like going beyond that. This trip was very rewarding because I was able to learn more about others from another area of the United States while also helping people who needed it. ",In fourth grade my school introduced us to Chinese. By 6th grade we were asked to commit to a language and I decided my language will be Chinese. It was very difficult for all of us who picked Chinese as a language. Most of the student in my class had to get tutors to help them pass the tests. My parents couldn’t afford getting a tutor so I struggled a lot. I had to basically go online to find tools that helped me succeed. One day I saw a flyer in my Chinese teacher’s office that talked about a language immersion summer camp in Vermont called the Middlebury Language Institute. I took the information to my mother and asked her if she can apply for me to go there during the summer for a month. My mom applied and I was awarded a scholarship. I attended the camps for two summers and this gave me advantage in Chinese during the school year; when classes started I was ahead of most of the students in my Chinese class.,"In some instances working solo is good but definitely working on a team is great for collaboration and learning from one another. Furthermore, everyone can pitch in and use their specific talents for the common goal of completing a project.

With this experience I can also learn how to incorporate such knowledge to many real world applications. Technology plays a huge role in the world that we live in toady and ther were a lot amazing influential moments that were created using technology whether it be a new beloved game franchise such as Mario or an extremely popular social media site like Facebook. I want to be a part of that world, that community with the ones that create something amazing with technology. Coding to me is very fun and there is a lot of freedom when it comes programing. I think that this program can help me truly experience the art of coding and how to use it when tackling real world problems or aspects of life that I want to improve. This program can help me think critically about how to tackle a problem, take it apart and look from each perspective of the situation and try to figure out how the best solution for the problem at hand. This program can really push me to develop new ideas about subjects that would totally excite me and inspire me to work harder on my projects making the experience so worth it.
","The part about technology that really excites me is that there is no limit to what you can create and the ideas that I can have. The freedom that you have is amazing and it allows to really think outside the box for a change, it that goes for things like creating websites, robots or video games. The areas of technology that I am interested in is virtual reality, developing games.","The colleges I would go to are MIT, USC, or Carnage Mellon. I would want to study in visuals art and computer programing. I want to study computer programing because I love exploring with technology and it is a passion of mine. To be specific I want to work on developing virtual worlds for fields like gaming. I love gaming and it is awesome; I even have many ideas for games I want to make in the future. When I am older I want to become a game designer. Visual arts is a subject that I want to study because art is another passion of mine. I especially love drawing in particular because I feel like I can express all my ideas clearly and fully threw drawing and it's therapeutic for me. This passion also pertains to game development because I like to develop my ideas for games threw drawing art and planning out the design. An obstacle that might prevent me from achieving my dream is the competition that I have with other scholars that want to go to the same place and have a similar dream. There is always someone that might be better than me at a certain subject and I have to work hard to not only reach their place, but to surpass them as well. Another obstacle is messing up a certain multistep project that might be long and messing one step can seriously hinder my progress. I am going to have to work hard and be very careful when doing my projects so I can avoid those kinds of situations; or if they come up I immediately know what to do, so the situation doesn't get worse. ","Last summer I was part of a swimming program. In the swimming program I was improving on my swimming skills. I already knew how to ""swim"" before I went to that camp, but there were so many things that I still had a bit of trouble with. Therefore, I decided to take part in the swimming program and work on things like maintaining my breathing and proper arm movement. The Swimming program was important to me because to me swimming is a way for me to keep my mind and body in check. Swimming is like an intense work out for me because unlike sports like soccer, where you are mainly focusing on your feet work, swimming includes every part of your body and put's your arms, torso and legs to work at once. I especially need a good work out every now and then. When you know how to move in the water then I can just flow and enjoy myself. ","One moment for when I struggled with an assignment was in art class when I was in my 1st trimester elective about Art and Design, and working on a project to present in an art show case. It was basically my final for the class and what I was planning on doing was creating a piece with a fabricated phoenix falling and rising out flames. I drew the phoenix and then gave it to my Art teacher, so she could send it somewhere to get it fabricated, so I could use it for my piece. For the flames I used an assortment of different fabrics and other materials such as colored paper and pipe cleaners. Unfortunately, My teacher came to me and told me that she had trouble getting my phoenix piece fabricated and there wasn't any other way to get the work done. I was worried that my piece wouldn't be finished before the showcase, which was coming up very quickly. With barely half of my project finished and the showcase being 2 days away and there being no way I could get the phoenix done in time, I had to think of a totally different approach for what I was going to present at the showcase. Fortunately, I came up with my plan. What I decided to do was take the art piece that I was most proud of, that I already have a pattern design for, which was different piece, and use that for my project. I printed out many copies of the paper and put them together to make the pattern very noticeable and some other designs showing the process of the work from the first sketch to the finished product. ","I can work on my own sometimes, but most of the time I would rather work as part of a team. I could work on my own with smaller projects because I can manage them better and make sure everything goes how I want it to. Plus, if I mess up one step I can quickly go back and try to fix it without it being too much of a hassle. On the other hand, when there is a much longer and bigger project I would prefer to work with others. Each member of a team can help with different parts of the project and put all of their effort and effort into those sections while still keeping in touch with everyone else. Working as part of a team can help me build up my communication skills and which is a great way to learn how to work with other people in any situation because I am going to have to face that at some point in my life whether it be for an assignment at school or with my fellow coworkers at any jobs. These are all very beneficial aspects of working with a team, but the best and most important part of working in a team to me is that I could possibly make new friends that I can have fun with while working on projects making my experience a lot more enjoyable.",5,Yes,michels2394@gmail.com,242326144,michels2394@gmail.com,Michel Sidemion,Michel Sidemion,,,0,Michel Sidemoin,Google,7,7,3,Runners Go!,"Games design, python, APIs, HTML, CSS, JS, p5.js, Processing","Caught up in small details, difficulty helping others",Game Dev.,,Stubborn,Tech,Tech,1

I have a deep desire on learning how to code. I see people coding and make programs and websites. I get interested quickly and want to learn how I can do that. I have a rheumatoid arthritis called ankhlysoning spondylitis. This can limit me from moving around in the future. The best part of why I love technology is that I must not be constantly moving around with my body and can sit behind a computer. This may seem that I am lazy but I cannot help it much. I try my best too move around and do the best I could in school and everywhere. I have a friend that went to this summer intensive, and he told me about it. He told me to try to see if I can get in because he said ""this was such an amazing program it teaches a lot and it's really fun."" My friends name is Anand I don't how he did, but I know he is really smart and can help me. I told that I want to study computer science or computer engineering or something to do with technology and a career I can do. When I was 10 years old I wanted to be a ""hacker."" Someone that can do whatever they want on anything. I know in computer science now that you can learn coding and that teaches a lot. Instead of hacking I can create my own stuff and access a lot of things by coding. ","The end products that can happen is what really excites me in technology. After you put something together using a computer language is what makes me excited a bit. Some programs excite me after I built trying it and learning it. It shows me how much words you put in to make something happen. I am interested in mostly every thing with technology. I like the few examples below of robotics, virtual reality, mobile applications, AI. I think the most Id prefer of technology would be computer programming and computer engineering. I think I really like anything to do with computers or with technology. In my school they have a couple of computer classes I think. I happen to take two this semester known as computer repair and engineering. In computer repair we talk about networking cables and aux cables and cable installations and much more other stuff to do with installing and trouble shooting networking cables. This class is like a career based class with technology with a lot of hands on. In engineering we talk about and create mini programs using scratch and python mostly. This class is like a into to computer programming. After school I am in the robotics club and its great. Were putting this robot together for a strong hold competition that is going to compete soon. To be honest I enjoy the classes I am taking now and the club I am. ",If money were no object and and I could go to any college I desired I would choose one of the best colleges around me. Not to far maybe come back home for the breaks and vacation and live there. Just in case if there was a family emergency. I would most likely do computer science. I think I would love coding and build my own programs. I have arthritis and a lot of jobs can be difficult for me as I grow older. One of the best things I think that I will love about computer science is that I can sit behind a computer and work there. This is because of my disease greatly affects the job I can work. The obstacles that might prevent me from achieving that dream is that if I do not do well in high school. The university will not accept me if I do not have high grades or get a higher grade on the SAT. I will need a great amount of money from scholarships because I do not want to have loans that I cannot pay for nor my parents. I would love to go to Stanford university or Massachusetts Institute of technology or maybe even Carnegie Mellon University. If I can study there then I will try to go.,"Last summer I visited the slums , in this case my homeland of Bangladesh. The most important thing I experienced is that I am living in America.It was more of a family trip that I wouldn't have gone on, I say this because of all the dreadful things I've seen which I never experienced in my life . I wish my my flight back was sooner that what it was but then I took time And I realized that I was living in a better life in America , and I had to experience living in a economy that doesn't suit me. I realized how people are suffering out there and how I should b grateful for a life I'm living . My parents moved to the United for a reason which was to bring brighter futures to me and my siblings. So I have to live up to that and make my future brighter than ever.
","The time that I mostly struggled with something in life was I think in school when I was in the seventh grade. It was very challenging for me to complete my work there. I had a hard time in social studies and math in the seventh grade. It was hard for me to work in school and get good grades. It was a struggle for me I do not know why though. I had to study more and learn a lot about English and a lot more classes in school. Although now I am smarter than I was a couple of years ago, I will push myself to get smarter and do great in school and not get distracted with people in my life that cannot help me.",I prefer working as a team if the team will actually help me complete an assignment. I am fine working solo but I like views and opinions from others that can help correct my errors. The best thing about working with a team is that there can be errors fixed by others you may have not not seen earlier. Before I worked in teams in school my classes some days I had a great team and I appreciated a lot. Other days I was in a team where not much people put in effort as much as I did. Although I would appreciate and work as a team.

I sincerely have always wanted to be an information technology specialist, or a software designer and this Summer Intensive program is my first great step towards realizing my awesome goal. All star Code is truly dedicated to educating men of color in computer technologies and coding, and their commitment is what drew me to this program. I hope to be challenged vigorously thus being able to learn coding effectively and in a practical way or a way that I can apply my knowledge to create a website , game, or even code electronics. Coding is truly the key to our modern world of electronics since every picture we take, game we play , or words we talk to virtual assistants are all made possible by code , therefore , I want to learn the ""science"" of coding and All star Code is the best and simplest source to help me .
          Moreover, the preparation for job skills needed in tech industry and mentorships with college guidance , which are all facets of All star Code, is another motivation for me to enroll in the Summer Intensive program. All Star Code fully exposes their students to the tech industry thus allowing them to learn in the environment ad requirements of a tech job. As a result, this produces prepared members and workers of companies. To add on,  All Star Code possess  plethora skilled mentors that guide new learners and help them ","Technology- just the words gets my head turning and my thinking gears spinning, I love it! Specifically, what excites me about technology is its promise to improve our lives ad even enhance our bodies and it practical applications and endless possibilities when you code. For instance new technologies such as 3D printing and nanotechnology hold amazing promises for the future. With 3D printing , we have the ability to actually take designed software on a computer and print layer by layer into an actual 3D part that can be utilized! Such a remarkable invention can be soon applied in printing out much needed hospital tools during an operation, building components for affordable housing , or even just regular day to day usage. With nanotechnology ,which is simply small microscopic robots that we would be specially be designed  for us to consume and they would be directed to attack virus and cancer cells and help us heal from our illnesses, these robots could even be designed into various forms and for many purposes. This field can have various extensive applications and is one of my personal hopes for the future . Undoubtedly technology holds much promise to improve our lives and even help us to live longer.
     Another exciting aspect of tchnology is the ability to use a machine or device to fufill many different awesome take all depending on the code you write. For instance a gaming device could be used to play a virtual reality game - a submersive  experience where your senses and ingenuity are required to survive in the game. However , that same machine could be use to come to to your phone to make a video call from it , or share  health data , or you could turn to device into a movie projector and this all mainly requires different types of programming and coding. Therefore, the fact that coding is so vast and there are some many different things that can be accomplished on the same device is what's excites me and amazes me about technology. As our phones get smarter that device in your pocket  can do more this allows our lives to be more productive. Coding popular cellular devices like the IPhone is one job or task I would like to learn and be exposed to. Personally my main interests in technology is building the hardware of a device especially the component that interacts with the software to make the device function smoothly. ","If money were no object , I would go to school at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and I would study computer engineering and software engineering . I have always wanted to be able to freely study how parts of a computer are designed  to function and how to build them and also to be able to design software that can be used to accomplish things. Also, studying these two majors will give me the freehand to construct a mind-boggling variety of programs and even construct a device that can be very useful in every day activity.
  Beside monetary issues, other obstacles that might prevent me from this dream is competition in entering the classes. There might be other students with better qualifications or prerequisites who are more eligible for the course and they might surpass me and get the opportunity instead of me. This is an increasing trend as the tech industry grows and there is a demand for computer relate jobs. Further another obstacle could be lack of success in my classes and this would obviously prevent me from ache icing the end goal. Lack of application of what I'm learning could also pose another issue because of what I am learning is challenging and I don't apply it outside the classroom I could easily forget. For instance,  if I am leaning about semiconductors or about the fundamentals of Python and I never build a model or try to code my own moch program my skills will fade away potentially resulting in my rejection of a job or position. So training is best","What I did last summer that was important to me  was that I took an accelerated math  class - Geometry. This class was during summer school and I was taught the main concepts and topics of geometry and i was taught drawing with a compass for about 6 weeks and then I took the regents. This was essential for me because this would push me ahead of the regular 10th grade math standard of geometry into 11th grade trig and would get me one step closer to taking calculus an important math class for computer science. So being able to take a math class that is utilized in coding was why this accelerated class was so essential to me personally. Additionally, this class allowed me to make myself a desirable candidate for a program such as All Star Code and that is why I was so ardent in taking the class.
	Another trip that I embarked on was a campaign trip in Promised Land State Park in Pennsylvania. My family, some friends, and I stayed in the natural park for 3 days and we slept in tents during the night among insects and nocturnal animals and we had to survive without electricity and at times enough food. Additionally, it rained for one whole day which ruined our materials and our plans. Nevertheless, the trip effectively taught me endurance, adaptation, and teamwork. I had to adapt to unfamiliar surroundings and being out with nature wiith all its annoying pests and weather, and I was compelled to work as a team with my friends to set up the tents, prepare foods and etc. Awesome!","A time when I struggled with something was definitely last year in my computer science class. When we had exams and we had to write code from scratch I literally wanted to pull my hair out! It was extremely difficult to write all the variables, conditions, conditions, and booleans correctly and and accurately. It took determination and much practice in order to improve my skills and my knowledge. Computer science was one of my most rigorous and engaging classes, it was truly the first class that I loved and wanted to learn all about but that I loathed in its work. I am glad that I endured  and I hope to take AP Computer Science. Another challenging project that I had was to build an Arduino car that moved and turned. This proved challenging because I had to wire the motors correctly with the arduino board and along with the breadboard. Next I had to code each analog and each motor and add delay codes that would act as timers and allow the car to change directions at specific times allowing it to drive inside a maze. This sounds fairly straightforward but adding the proper delays was a daunting challenge along with implementing the commands of RotateLeft, TurnAround and more. This project was a marvel but challenging at the same time, opening my eyes to the realities of computer science","I prefer to be a part of a team rather than working by myself because in a team you you can effectively collaborate and get more done, you have the input of other teammates thus making your work better and more effective, and the finished product could be more marvelous and effective. Working in a team allows you to get feedback from others thus allowing compromises to be made by the teammates and a decision to be reached with ease and reasonableness. Finally , this allows more progress to be made in less time. In a real world situation, this collaboration is essential to accomplishing tasks in real time so working in a group is necessary and much more profitable than working alone which will result in slow progress and potentially a loss of your job. Additionally, in a team you will get blunt, honest feedback on your work or contributions allowing you to improve to the best of your ability and be a dynamic part of the team. By working by yourself, you only have your ideas and opinions which might be flawed or unethical resulting in  your creation being a failure. Undoubtedly, being  able to have constructive criticism to improve your creation is imperative if you want to stay competitive in the tech industry. Lastly , I enjoy working in a team because the final creation that results from collaboration and ingenuity is beautiful and more great then anything produced alone, therefore watching the end result is one of my favorite reasons of being apart of a team.",6,Yes,Nbonsu8934@Taps391.org,242309493,Nbonsu8934@Taps391.org,,Nana Bonsu,,,0,Nana Bonsu,MLB,6,7,7,Salvico,GM,,CS career,"Would stay for office hours, which was a big help for him",Disruptive,Tech,Tech,1

I am interested in becoming a computer software and an electrical engineer. The skills an engineer needs are based on the specialty he or she chooses, but all engineers need to have a solid science and math background. My current math and science grades can demonstrate that I have a strong background in these subjects but I have no practical experience that would be helpful in an actual employment setting. For example, engineers need to be good communicators, since so much of their work is shared with other scientists, as well as with the public, and other non-engineers. However I need to practice communicating in scientific jargon within a group of my peers who are also interested in computer programming. This program will give me that experience. Being able to work in a team is also important and I can get valuable experience in working on projects within this controlled setting. I will also be able to interact with other students who have common interests.","As previously stated I am interested in becoming a computer software or an electrical engineer.
Computer software is continually changing in order to keep up to date with the latest technology. Today, computer software is utilized in almost every aspect of present society. For instance, health care, law enforcement, finance, etc. Computer software engineers are required to learn other knowledge besides computer software, which can make this field very versatile. Electrical engineering can be a dual major with computer engineering in college because electrical engineering is the basis of all engineering. Without electricity, technology such as iPhones, laptops, subway cars, and even bridges would not exist. I’m interested in a program that offers electrical and software engineering as a dual major.
","If money was no object, I would go to MIT. I would study both electrical and computer engineering as a dual major. I like acquiring new knowledge in these fields. They are continually changing thus providing me with an opportunity to always learn new things and to be challenged. A major obstacle that might prevent me from attending this university is lack of money.

","Last summer, I participated in CSTUY, a coding intensive where I was introduced to the basics of coding. I was able to use the program Processing to make a game similar to BrickBreaker. I worked with a team of two other individuals to develop and present this game at a computer science fair at the end of the program. This was important to me because it provided an introduction to coding as well as working with a team of new people.

","I have practiced and played the flute continuously for the past ten years. During many times over that ten-year period I considered stopping especially when it became increasingly difficult to juggle school work with learning to read music while practicing new and often difficult music pieces. With encouragement from my parents and my flute instructor I persevered. I began to see progress and improvement in my skills and it became a source of great motivation to me. My skills improved immensely over that time. Through this I learned that persistence and consistency are important to the accomplishment of any long-term goal. I have applied these principles to many difficult times in my academic career and they have served me well.

","I prefer to work as part of a team because I like interacting with other people and exchanging ideas. In a group setting, everyone brings a different set of skills and knowledge that can be useful in a project environment. Each member of the team is valuable to the completion of a project. Engineers usually work in teams and not by themselves when completing projects.

Another obstacle may be adjusting to college life because it would be a new experience for me. I am sometimes shy which makes it hard for me to get to know others and interact.,Last Summer I went to George Washington University in Washington D.C. for week. This is important to me because I got to live on a college campus for a week and experience a bit of college life. We also visited other colleges located in Washington while staying there. This was important to me because I want to go to college after graduating high school so visiting a college made me get a picture of what it would be like if i choose to go to that college. It showed me some of my college preferences and what type of college I may want to go to.,A time I struggled with something was in school in geometry class when the students had to work on a question involving kites and I was having a hard time finding the angle measures using the rules they had taught us. What was challenging about it was that it required you to apply other properties as well. I tried multiple ways to solve it but I kept hitting the same road-block. I took a while to analyze the problem without coming to a conclusion so I asked a fellow student for help and they told me that I needed to use other properties as well and gave me some examples. This led me to think of other ways that I could solve it which led me to finding the right path to solving the angle measures of the kite.,I prefer working as a team because when I work in a team I feel like I can get more done than when I try to do it alone. Working with a team also helps me think differently than normally would. Being on a team brings many different opinions to the table.

I’ve been interested in coding and technology since I was in fifth grade, and we started messing around making games in Scratch. Since then I’ve taken courses in HTML/CSS and Processing, helped younger students at my school with similar classes, participated and competed in city hackathons between many other schools, and more. Though I do have a decent knowledge of coding and am pretty good at grasping such concepts quickly, I don’t feel like I have opportunities for enough of this anymore. My school’s mandatory technology course ended last year, and unfortunately due to my rigorous schedule, with two maths, two sciences, AP electives, and more, I simply can’t find the time throughout the school year to attend online AP computer science courses, technology electives, etc. This is one reason I thought that taking such a diverse and in depth course over the summer was both perfect in terms of timing and academics.","I think the thing that excites me most about technology is the rate at which it’s progressing; The field of technology is expanding and improving faster than medicine, law, mathematics, or really anything. We’ve gone from phones that could only call and somewhat send texts to phones that can utilize and place a person in virtual reality, in the span of merely ten years. As to particular areas of technology that interest me, I’m particularly interested in robotics and also mobile apps - robotics because I think that robots are going to be the biggest thing within a few years, and already there are some incredibly impressive robots that can do things most humans can’t. They can be used in almost any field, in hospitals, the military, education, residents, etc. As to mobile apps, phones are something that have gone from being a luxury to practically an essential. By being able to develop apps that can make one’s life more efficient, people have more time to spend doing other things, and an app as simple as Mail, or Reminders, can save hours from a person’s day, increasing productivity for society as a whole.","A college that I’ve always considered my ‘dream college’ is MIT.
If I did go there, I would probably major in something like Computer Science, and the reason for this is because it’s at the moment the leading school in technology and similar fields (as the name suggests), and those are also the fields that are most prominent in our future. I’ve seen videos and images and read articles about the countless feats achieved at that one college, the machines students have made, and I think it would be both incredible and beneficial to be around a group like that.","Last summer, my family and I took a nearly two month trip to Bangladesh, the country both of my parents are from. Typically we don’t go on vacation, but due to being busy previous summers with a program called Prep for Prep and other academics, this was the first time since 2010 where all of us could go. There, I met family that I hadn’t seen in five years, new family I had never seen in my life, and more. I did take a break from academics and other things (and completed them before the trip), as I thought it was a good idea to spend some quality time with important people in my life I almost never had a chance to see. Since the majority of my dad’s side of the family and the entirety of my mom’s side lives there, it was honestly an incredible experience and I really do wish we had the time and money to do this every summer.","Prep for Prep is a rigorous program that strives to help minorities boost their education by placing them through a very tough 2 year program. Throughout these two years I faced some of my most difficult moments, late nights, nearly impossible homework assignments, last minute preparation, etc. One week I distinctly recall was the week of finals at Prep. I was in almost all honors classes, and thus our expectations were extremely high. I wasn’t the best at studying, I got distracted easily, and overall I couldn’t figure out how to cram for 5 huge exams covering a year of material in merely a few days. Ultimately I did considerably well on most of the tests, mainly because I attempted to organize myself. I’m a bit of a neat freak and like to work ahead and thoroughly on assignments, but I had never had the level of organization I managed to find that week while cramming for exams. I spent an hour or two simply setting up a schedule for myself, organizing notes from the year, finding folders and labels, looking for month old flashcards, study guides, etc, and ultimately found that those two hours saved me 10 or 20 in the long run.","I personally prefer working as part of a team. Though being independent has it’s advantages, from not having any competition to being able to do work on your own schedule, I think the pros of working as part of a team easily outweighs those.
For starters, it’s more productive, as tasks can be split up; it’s more educational, hearing what other people have to say about a certain topic or assignment, and ultimately it’s just more fun being surrounded by a team trying to help you rather than going about something alone.

Python has enabled me to create several programs, such as input and output program that collects data, in a survey format. These programs inspire me to develop better storage data programs. I believe that All Star Code will help build my knowledge in other computer programming languages.
   As a member of Enza Academy, an entrepreneurship incubator, I participated in their 2015 Hackathon. During this Hackathon, the host started by asking the audience to mention 10 white entrepreneurs, and almost everyone responded. However, when the host asked the audience to mention 5 black entrepreneurs, the room was almost silent.
   After this seminar, I decided to become a black entrepreneur that people will not only remember, but look up to. I believe that participating in All Star Code intensive Summer Program will help me attain this goal.","   Technology is not just a tool; it is an opportunity to change the world. The fact that technology is a never ending chain of development is spectacular. With technology imagination become reality, and dreams become goals.To me, one of the most intriguing aspect of technology is mobile application.
    Mobile applications extend not only to computer programmers, but to people all over the world, because phones are used virtually everywhere in the world. Phones allow the user to manipulate its functions, and through that, more functions are created to maximize the capabilities of the phone, while minimizing its complexity. This chain of innovation is something that drives my imagination to think more, thus increasing my zeal to create more.
    Additionally, mobile applications are tools capable of encouraging and inspiring many more innovators to come. Because of the mass numbers of people who use mobile applications, reaching out to the world is more facile. Innovators such as Mark Dean, who helped developed the ISA bus, used this opportunity to become eminent as a computer engineer. Moreover, I believe that the stories of successful technologists will embolden underrepresented groups to become more active in their contribution to technology.
     With technology, learning becomes a process. By this process, I find myself motivated to know more about the creation of mobile device; and determined to change underrepresented groups from being the predominant consumers of technology to becoming more of the creators of tomorrow.","     The need for money has tremendously changed my view of life. This necessity has influenced me to pursue a career in economics and computer science. My father constantly reminds me that a stable career that is pursued with fervor brings happiness. However, if money was no object, then I would only study computer science.
    Computer science is not the career I choose to pursue just because I love computers, but because I can understand and easily grasp its mathematical concepts. When my older brother introduced me to Python, a computer programming language, learning it was fairly easy. Moreover, the fact that I can create whatever I wanted with codes consistently encourages me to learn more.
    If money was no object, I would strive to attend the University of Pennsylvania. However, I think my SAT score may affect the university’s choice to accept me, if it doesn’t not meet their requirements. In addition, I may not have as many extra curricular activities as they may require. Even with that, I believe that my grades and personal essay will help me get accepted into other competitive colleges.  As Morihei Ueshiba, founder of the Japanese martial art aikido, said “failure is the key to success, each mistake teaches us something” ; and I believe that everything I learn can always be used as a testimony for who I am today.
","   When I started my freshman year of high school, I was uncertain about what career I wanted to pursue, influencing me to see school as burden, rather than an opportunity. However, my view of school changed after I attended Fordham STEP Summer Program. Now, I am more than grateful for being a part of the community Fordham STEP created.
   After this summer program, my passion for computer science and entrepreneurship increased immensely; inspiring me to strive for the best education I can possibly have. For as Nelson Mandela once stated, “Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.” Fordham STEP gave me the opportunity to take Pre-Calculus, prepared me for my biology Regents Exam, and exposed me to people whose lives constantly inspire me to become successful.
   Fordham STEP has provided me not only with valuable education, but gave me exceptional mentor-ship. This experience with Fordham STEP is one I dearly cherish till this day; because it helped center my focus in my academics.
","   Challenging myself is something I try to do constantly. When I was in middle school, I challenged myself to take two 9th grade classes and the regents, allowing me to receive two high school credits. However, one of the most challenges situations I have ever been through was the beginning of my junior year of high school. My schedule included 4 AP classes, one Pre- AP class, and 1 College Now class. At this time, time management and grade maintenance became very stressful.
   Along with tedious homework from almost every class, I had to attend weekly youth meetings at my church.  This limited the amount I slept, thus reducing my attentiveness in classes. One day my mother had a discussion with me, and one of the things that stood out was when she said “doer of all, master of none.” After this discussion, I became stricter in scheduling my time, and removed one of my AP classes, AP Studio Art. Although this was very difficult, I knew that making these decisions would allow me to better focus on my other courses.
   This time period taught me that wisdom with perseverance can accomplish many things. Now, I am cautious of many of the decisions I make, and manage my time with a schedule. Although I disliked myself during that time period, I cherish the lessons I have learned from it.","    Through many mistakes and successes, I have learnt to work both on my own, and with other people. As a growing teenager, I have learned to discipline myself when working alone and in doing so, I learned how to properly prioritize my work, and personal desires. In the same manner, I have been taught how to listen to others attentively and with empathy, and I have learned how to appropriately respond. For these reasons, I prefer working alone when there is a need to; and prefer working as part of a team, when I am unable to complete a task alone.
    When working alone I can easily maneuver the style in which I decide to approach a problem. With this, I can avoid disagreements or arguments when in a group, thus saving time. On the other hand, when working with a group there are more people, therefore allowing for the even distribution of work, which also saves time. With a group, each member develops their own voice and perspective in relation to peers, which increases the strength of an individual socially. Moreover, when working solo, it is sometimes more productive, because I am more focused, when there aren’t too many discussions occurring at once.
   For these reasons, my preference vary in the kind of task I am appointed. However, I do enjoy working both ways. For in each experience I learn something, and I believe that anything I learn can be used as a testimony of who I am.",5,Yes,olojedejide@gmail.com,241758899,olojedejide@gmail.com,Olaoluwa Olojede,Olaoluwa Olojede,,checked,1,Olaoluwa Olojede,MLB,2,8,7,Salvico,"HTML, CSS, JS, APIs, public speaking","Shy, disheartened when teammates are not working as hard as he is",Finance or corporation,"Went out of his way to learn another programming language and made an android app. First to arrive, last to leave.

I moved from New York to Alabama in 2014, after having lived there since I was born. So I would love to be involved in something I love, in the city I love. I've had an interest in Comp-Sci since I was 11, and I built my first computer. After that I felt like I had to do something Comp-Sci related since it made things like Operating systems, video games, and hardware possible. That pretty much sums up why I love technology. It's ubiquitous, and a huge part of our lives today.","Almost everything excites me about technology. The advancement of mobile hardware, software design, virtual reality, and wearable technology are just a few of the things I am looking forward to. All these technologies are bringing us closer, and closer to our idealized version of the future. I'm definitely interested in seeing where the VR market goes with the release of the Oculus Rift, and HTC Vive. At the moment they're not really easily accessible to the average consumer, but I'm definitely interested in seeing where they go. Augmented reality also looks promising, and I can't wait to see what Microsoft does with the Hololens.    ","If I could go anywhere I would love to go to Columbia, or MIT. They are both amazing schools, and I'd be honored to get into either one. I would probably something in engineering. As nice as a computer science degree is, I could easily learn Python, and do the basic logic courses required early on without the help of a school. An engineering degree also seems like it could open up more doors in the future. That, and the fact that I would be right back at home in NY or CT are my main reasons. I would say if anything holds me back it would be my grades. Moving made Freshmen year a little daunting, and as Sophomore I feel as though I finally know my place, and how important success in highschool actually is.  ","Over the summer I went to a program called Leadership Huntsville to learn more about the city, and get to know the community more. I did some community service there, and participated in a simulation of what living below the poverty line was like. We also got work with some kids who were less fortunate which wasn't necessarily eye opening, but it definitely helped put in perspective how lucky I am to have the life I do. I did the program to help me acclimate to my new home, but I also ended up making a lot of new friends. I found the experience to be a lot of fun, and I learned a lot. ","At the beginning of the school year, there was an announcement during assembly about a entrepreneur contest. The grand prize was $1000, and a temporary workplace for the summer. I reluctantly joined after it was suggested by my parents. However, about a month or two in I was feeling anxious because I felt my project wasn't good enough. I ended up dropping out. A couple months later my Mom who volunteered to help work the event learned that my name had not been removed from the program. I figured it would look bad to have my name be in the program, and not show up. So I quickly put on a suit, and wrote my presentation in the car. It was a proposal for a store similar to Build-A-Bear Workshop, only it sold PC parts instead. I went in unsure of how it would go over, and I walked out with 2nd place. While I didn't get the $1000 or office space, I walked out with something else. Confidence. ","I love working as a team when I know them well, or when I work well with a particular group of people. However, I don't like working with people who can't pull their own wait. In cases where my group members aren't helpful, I prefer to work alone. The upside to working alone is I get full creative freedom, but I also have to do the workload by myself. When working in a team I have to compromise, but the work can be divided. I enjoy working with people I depend on. Otherwise, I would rather work alone.",5,Yes,richdavis13@gmail.com,242431721,richdavis13@gmail.com,,Richard Davis ,,,1,Richard Davis,Google,3,7,3,Gramaphone,"API, HTML, CSS, JS, python","Stays with more experienced students, but clearly lacks understanding in core concepts.

My school unfortunately does not offer many computer science or technology based courses. I came to learn of All Star Code’s Summer Intensive from a close friend, and from his stories, I can immediately deduce that this program will exceed my wildest imaginations. The teamwork and creativity are just some of the few attractive figures of the Summer Intensive. Working on projects with other people who love computers and coding is the best experience anyone can have. The best way to develop a full understanding of a topic is to actually perform the topic. Working with other people gives you more ideas that you can gather and learn from in addition to a better understanding of the topic. The All Star Code Summer Intensive presents the best opportunity for coding.","Technology is a beautiful subject, and since I was little, I have been intrigued by its aura. From my first hand held console, the PlayStation Portable (PSP) I was amazed at how such a little device could create such an amazing experience. Soon after, I would have my own computer and my love for technology started there. Technology excites me because it such a prevalent part it our lives today, but it seems simple. The only reason it seems simple is that technology is designed to make our lives simple. However, in the root of every program, of every bit of data is a complex system that fulfills our everyday needs. The actual code of the software, the specific parts of a computer, the roots of all technology, this is what I am interested in most. I actually began teaching myself C++ just to develop a better understanding of all the programs I use. The problem solving aspect of technology is what really excites me. ","The California Institute of Technology and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are my dream schools. The two rival schools from opposite ends of the country are where I want to go to college. On my PSAT’s I wrote down computer science as my major in college. Both of these schools can provide an overwhelming amount of resources, knowledge, and opportunities regarding computer science. In addition, these schools are both elite and famous schools and only admit those that are ready to be leaders and change the world. To be a part of these schools speaks volumes of my capabilities and my experience.
The intense competition will be my only obstacle on the path to my dream schools. To make myself the best candidate possible I must have a large background in technology before applying to these schools. All Star Code and my own personal projects are key elements to my overall portfolio. The projects themselves are not an obstacle because they can only bring me benefit. I love computers, coding, and anything dealing with technology. Any internships or program I take part in will only strengthen my application process for the severe competition.
","Last summer I did two things that are very important to me. I participated in my first internship, and I went to Bangladesh to see my family. I was an intern at the Fieldston Enrichment Program (FEP). The program itself prepares children from New York City for the Secondary School Admissions Test (SSAT) and the Independent School Entrance Examination (ISEE). FEP helped me get into my current school Church Farm School. The internship is important to me because I had my first experience of being a leader to a group of people. I served as a team leader to a group of students and together we created a team that performed exceptionally at the tournament at the end of the program.
My trips to Bangladesh have always had a huge impact on my outlook on life. There are countless people in Bangladesh that face poverty. Whenever I travel to the villages, I see those that suffer on a daily basis. As a Muslim giving back to the community is one of our five pillars and my family comes from poverty. Recently we have started a school so that children can obtain an education and possibly advance themselves in the future. Bangladesh is important to me because it represents my origins and my values. I do not take anything for granted, and I never forget the hard work my family has done for me.
","School is not designed to be easy, and it never was. As a result, no subject is easy, but certain subjects can be grasped quicker. For me, English Language Arts proved to be the subject I would grasp the slowest. Although I achieved high marks in Honors English, I feel as though I often have to struggle in order to keep my average high. For example, in my class we have recently finished reading The Catcher in the Rye. This novel was a wonderful one, and a novel that I could not fully understand. In my class, we discussed the main character, Holden, and his struggles. However, I did not see any struggle within Holden’s life, and as a result, I often could not add to the discussion. To solve this I chose to trust my thinking and I interpreted the text in a completely different manner. I sought to find reasons why Holden should take advantage of the opportunities and resources he has instead of being a dropout. I brought a new perspective to the table and ended up benefitting the class with my argument. By doing so, I displayed my values to the class and acted as a leader of the discussion.","I have neither a preference nor distaste when it comes to working. I believe my work ethic is strong in both areas. As long as I am able to give the task my all and allow my teammates and myself to exceed the expectations, I have no problem working solo or a team.
There are benefits to working alone and working within a team. However, any large coding project will always require both forms of work. Every line of code that is written will be reviewed one hundred times over. Therefore, the first step to writing code is to create an open mindset so that your work, and your partners work can be finished in a timely fashion. As a coder, you will always do your part and have it edited by your teammate. A program is like a well-oiled machine; all parts must be working in harmony or else the entire system falls apart.
In my opinion, as long as I am able to finish my job I can achieve the benefits of both teamwork and solo work. The lessons I learn, and my takeaways are the important parts in any project. I can learn from trial and error when doing solo work, and I can learn from other people when doing teamwork. In the end, I get what I truly desire. If I am put alone or with people one thing I can always assure is that my work will be of my best abilities.

I'm also interested to see how technology actually works at a smaller level and how this can affect technology at a larger scale.For example,the effect coding on a program and it's consequences on businesses and corporations.","The thing that really excites me about technology is the impact that it will have on our future. Also what excites about technology is new hardware,like new phones,gaming consoles,and computers. A particular area that interest me is engineering in technology. This is because I want to innovate the future and make things better for everyone and everything. For example,finding a way to reduce carbon dioxide from the atmosphere with some sort of machine,which would run on water. I know this idea sounds preposterous,but all new inventions have to start from a crazy idea,otherwise we would all be thinking the same and getting no where with new inventions. ","If money wasn't an issue,I would go to college at the California Institute of Technology. Here I would study engineering. This is because since I was very small till now,I have always liked to take things apart and put them back together. To me,this offered a sort of satisfaction. The obstacles that might prevent me from achieving this dream are my extracurricular activities. My high school is a newly formed high school and doesn't have many extracurricular activities. This might hurt my college application because they want to see what students can do other then just academics.","Something I did last summer that wad very important to me was the STEM program at the New York City Community College. In this program I studied pre-calculus and physics. Although these were great courses to take and challenging,that wasn't the most important part. The most important part was being able to meet new people. Also being able to work in a group for a physics project. The project was very successful.Being in this group showed me how other students think and how dedicated some of these students were. It also showed them that there are other students out there dedicate to do something big.","A time I struggled with something was when I took physics at a STEM program at the New York City Community  College over the summer.I had never taken a physics course before this,but I was fascinated by the work done in this field. At first things were simple,but as things usually do,it got more complex.I could no longer understand or follow the math the professor was doing because he was using units of measure in the math to arrive at a new equation.I personally was never used to this because in high school math I was never taught to use them when solving something but instead just the numbers and then put the units at the end. Although this was a six week program,I had to buy a book on physics to try and understand what was going on  in the class. I also ended up staying a couple of times after class was over to try and understanding the topic taught that day in class.In the end,I ended up passing the class.","I rather work as a team.This is because working as a team helps me see flaws that I wouldn't have seen working alone.Although working solo feels more natural to me,working in a group helps me overcome more obstacles and be more productive.Working as a team does have its drawbacks however.For example,if a member of the team doesn't know the content,then the entire team will have to slow down for that particular person.Despite this,working as a team allows for better work and less flaws in a project. Also working as a team allows people to hear other people out and their ideas,which allows for a better and stronger project.",4,Yes,Samuel.smith107@gmail.com,242423627,Samuel.smith107@gmail.com,,Samuel Almonte,,,0,Samuel ALmonte,Google,0,7,3,Dispute,"HTML, CSS, JS",Focus,Web Dev.,,Focus,Tech,Neutral,0

Therefore, getting into this program would be a great boon and will help me to gain experience over the summer in coding. I promise to do my utmost best.
","Technology is boundless; anything can happen and be made as a result of technology. Personally, one interesting area of technology is video game development. Most people have played at least one video game, whether it be a video game on a home console, such as Super Smash Bros., or a video game on a smart phone, such as Candy Crush. There are no age limits to these games and they aren’t exclusive to one type of person. An enormous industry has been built around video games, billion-dollar companies are catering to gamers worldwide by offering services based on their needs, for example Amazon owns Twitch.tv, a platform that allows video game competitions and the play-through of video games to be streamed via desktop computers, video games console, and smart phones. Amazon has also developed a microconsole designed to stream music, movies, and shows, to a television, and play videogames. Another giant company, Google, has also forayed into the world gaming. Recently the company has launched a version of YouTube, “built solely for gamers”, giving them access to tools similar to Twitch. In fact, Google has also released a microconsole capable of gaming, the Nexus Player. If these huge companies are investing in video games it’s obvious that the video game industry is booming. So, the booming industry and my interest in developing games make me very excited about technology.","“[Advancing] knowledge and [educating] students in science [and] technology,” is the mission of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and if money were no object, I would attend MIT to study Electrical Engineering & Computer Science. MIT is renowned for having several of the best and most rigorous engineering programs in the world. Attending MIT would allow me the opportunity to challenge myself and strive for success while meeting like-minded individuals. Besides, there is no limit to what you can do with technology, computers in particular. If I entered Computer Engineering there will be no limits to what I can do. In just the past few years several life-changing innovations have already been made that prove how vast the possibilities of Computer Engineering are. One such innovation is the usage of 3D printing in the medical field. I remember reading an article the other day about how limbs and organs are currently being printed with living tissues, and are being donated to people in need. Another spectacular use of Computer Engineering is the development of self-driving, or autonomous cars, which could bring forth numerous benefits.  For example, human blunders while driving could be completely erased, like driving while under extreme emotional stress. Also, more people would be able to ride in cars unaided - the blind, the elderly, or those under the influence. A few obstacles that might prevent me from achieving my dream are my grades and my extracurriculars.","Last summer was pretty eventful for me. During the first half, I volunteered at a transfer high school in Brownsville, Metropolitan Diploma Plus High School, and for the rest of summer vacation I traveled to my birthplace, Guyana. Together these two events made last summer extremely important to me. While volunteering at the school, I assisted in tutoring students in danger of failing their courses. In addition, I assisted with some clerical duties around the office. For example, answering the telephone, making photocopies, stamping books, sorting and filing of documents, and sorting and packing supplies. It was a good experience because I had the opportunity to see how students and staff function in the workplace on a daily basis. However, after summer school my family and I flew to Guyana. Once I arrived I was bombarded with hugs and kisses from all my relatives who still live there. I visited a lot of family friends who watched over me as a toddler. Everybody was able to see how much I have matured, since I haven’t been to Guyana years. It was fun socializing with my family and friends. In the end, my summer was a very important one because the students passed their classes and graduated and I felt good for them and about myself.","This year I have to take Trigonometry, and admittedly it’s hard and I’m struggling. Trigonometry requires a lot of time to stay on top of everything, and with all my other classes I don’t exactly have that time. There are several formulas to remember and a lot of real world problems to solve. Math word problems usually get more complicated for me when they are too long. So at this time I am trying different methods to get better at the subject. I’m looking at online tutoring websites on Algebra and putting aside more time to study. I am also considering taking time off from my lunch break to go to tutoring for Algebra. I have a test coming up soon and I hope that these methods will help me. Depending on how I do on the test, I will decide on the next step.","Normally, I like working by myself.  The reason why I like to work solo is that it sets a standard for my work and keeps it constant; something that group projects don’t always have due to the number of differentia minds working on them - minds that may not always see the same final product. However, most projects require teamwork, because it is beneficial when everyone puts their knowledge and thoughts into a project toward one common goal. Working as part of a team provides the opportunity for diversity. Every culture has its own way of doing things; each member has his/her own approach of doing things. Socialization is another benefit of working as part of a team. Since humans are social creatures, most people enjoy forming bonds with teammates and enjoy small talks that do not always relate to the project. So even though I prefer working solo, I welcome the opportunity of working as part of a team.",6,Yes,shamroypellew@aol.com,242401088,shamroypellew@aol.com,,Shamroy Pellew,,checked,1,Shamroy Pellew,Alley,0,8,8,All Star Olympics,"HTML, JS, p5.play, Python, Design",Public Speaking,Game Dev.,Stayed for office hours,Speaking,Tech,Tech,1

I use computers every day and a lot of things about computers and technology seems interesting to me. The interest kept growing the more as I played PC Games. PC games is really interesting to me more than console gaming which sadly 90% of my friends do. PC gaming is so much interesting because of the multitasking, so much customizability, computers are so much involved in my life that I want to have a career in computers and to do that I feel like I want to learn programming and work with others and learn from a lot of mistakes that I am going to make while learning. That is one of the main reasons why I am interested in the All Star Code summer intensive.","I really love technology. I am not sure to exact reason why, but if I know myself more than anybody else, well basically it's evolution. This is an in depth thought that I was thinking in why I love technology. I know humans are not going to evolve physically and mentally much and if they do its going to take a very long time, so evolving technologically is very important. Technology has done a lot of things for me that I am more than thankful for. Technology has made my life so much easier especially for a person that's childhood was almost without any kind of technology like computers and etc. Technology which are especially computers have made my life not only easier but it was a lot of fun and entertainment. Computers have made me the person who I am today. In computers I have been interested in mainly building and fixing computers, but I know that it's not going to be a much good of a career and the pay is probably going to be low and that's mainly because not only a lot of people are learning how to build computers fast which means less people would actually would buy a manufactured pc like HP, Dell, lenovo, and etc. and even less likely to go to a computer shop to make the people that work their make it for them for whatever reason. And what is even more problematic for me to get a career out of this is could gaming. People are not going to require to even build computers for gaming and that's going to really reduce jobs and careers in building computers and fixing. So I decided to want to have a better career, which is computer programming and I, not only want to learn programming for my career, but also my urge and, main goal in life to save the world and make it a lot more better place. When I mean world I mainly mean life, I want to save as much people as I can using different skills especially programming which can help me do ethical hacking and creating programs to help save people's lives from corruption, war, natural disasters and etc.","If money were no object, the college I would go to is MIT. I haven’t really thought too much into college yet, but that's one of the colleges that I am pretty interested in going because of so much tech opportunities. I have always been really into technology. It's a form of human evolution into greater Heights and its really entertaining learning about technology to me. Other than technology I would want to study politics, government, philosophy, and etc to understand and find solutions to fix this twisted society. I may have true convictions and actual good reasons for wanting to study the things I want to study, but one of the major obstacle I do and will face is my brain. Unlike other people, I am not smart and i don't excel in a lot of things sadly. I may understand a lot about the truth about society and i am a little bit of a philosopher, but my mind and brain gets in the way of my main goal which is to change the world for the better. Also even after just my mind and brain, money would still be an issue as my family is not rich and working and paying for college is something I am not sure I can do and even trying to get loan, I don't know if I can even pass through college to get at least a master’s degree or maybe PHD, but whether I can do all that or not, learning about programming and computers will always interest me and I really want to learn about it no matter what, even if I can't understand it good enough.","Last summer was one of the best summers I have ever had in a long time. I was partially able to achieve my goal. In a sense I did archive my goal fully, but I wasn't satisfied. Well my goal was to upgrade my pc or even better, build one. But because of lack of money and trying to not waste money and good parts that I already had, I had to upgrade my computer because of my own interest in gaming as a hobby and the interest in building something that felt really useful to me. I have learned and researched a lot about computers and especially how to build them throughout the whole summer until the end of summer where I was pretty confident I can upgrade my pc without running into issues. So you must be wondering what I upgraded? Well I upgraded my graphic card, power supply, and added another hard drive for extra space for my games and other programs.  When I actually did the upgrade it took me almost a whole day to do it, it took a lot of time yet it was simple to do. When I finally upgraded my pc I had even more knowledge about computers and at a point where I was able to fix them with ease for many of the problems it ran into. Also during the summer, my friend was going to throw away his 4 year old pc because it stopped working, but then I told him I think it’s fixable or even if its not I can still have fun tinkering with it. So he sold me that pc for $15 and I was able to fix it even though the problem that it had was pretty rare. In the end I felt proud doing those things.","Struggle is part of life. But one of the main things that I struggled with was really bad, to a point where I wanted to die and life felt so useless and had practically no meaning. One of the main problem was that, in my quest in bringing peace and justice to this society, I couldn’t find a real solution in how to do this especially when I am only one man against the world ready to give his life to save others. Also I am not sure what sort of system I want to bring and what sort of change I would want to make in this capitalist system. It was so annoying until my teacher explained I should go to college and learn many different skills which especially includes programing since I am interested in getting a career based on technology like computers. I know I am still young, but it feels really short because of the goal of bringing peace and changing the world for the better. I am really not like most people in this world, I have a different mindset than others. I may not be that smart, but I know and understand enough to want and work for change for the better.","I mainly like working solo. Working solo feels better and I would feel less pressure. I don't mind working in a team as long as everyone does what they are supposed to. Everybody has to do their own part. Also, I don't like working in part of a team because of the pressure they might give me to do something fast or on time when I am doing my best to do what I have to do. Also working in team makes me nervous at times because of the thought of messing up and the fact that it’s going to effect the people around me. I want to help others as much as possible and I am willing to do almost anything to do so, whether I have to work solo or in a team.",4,Yes,islamshuhanul@gmail.com,242421236,islamshuhanul@gmail.com,,Shuhanul Islam,,,1,Shuhanul Islam,Alley,1,3,N/A,Rally,"Physical computing, Googling, HTML","Basic CS, maturity","Web.

When it comes to creating a piece of technology, you need to learn how to code. Knowing that coding is the bloodline to make that piece of technology work is amazing. Since I already have little knowledge of Python and HTML, I would like to gain a better understanding on how to use it. By being a participant in this program, I believe that I can accomplish that goal.
","What really excites me about technology is the power you have to make that piece of technology custom to you. Also, technology makes everyone's life much easier. Without technology I wouldn't be living where I live now because there wouldn't be any cranes to build houses or computers to make blueprints. I am interested in computer science, civil engineering, and mechanical engineering.
","If money were no object, I would like to go to MIT for college. I would like to study computer science or/and mechanical engineering and/or civil engineering. Ever since I was small I loved construction work, I like seeing a bunch of trucks and cranes working together to complete one big project. I also love working with power tools because they give you the ability to build things more easily and faster. Also, ever since I did an engineering program over the summer I found out how amazing coding was. Coding gave you the ability to make thinks the way you want it to be but the electronic way. An obstacle that might prevent me from achieving this dream would be not getting a 4.0 GPA to get into MIT and not enough money to pay off my college years.
","Last summer I did a program called BlueStamp Engineering. It's a program where students that are inspired to make cool gadgets go and prototype their ideas. You buy all the electronic components online and then put them all together when they get to the program site and then program it to the way you want it to work. Although it may sound easy, it's not because the building part involves knowing about all the electronic components you are going to use in your project to try to prevent from shorting/burning them out. Also, soldering all these electronic components is involved which could get a little tricky if you are not an expert. Then, the hardest part is coding the project because it can involve a lot of writing and keeping track of all the parts that need to be coded perfectly in order for the other parts to work. This program is very important to me because it was the first program I ever did. Also, this program introduced me to all the different parts of electronic components, like a Raspberry Pi,  and learn about what coding was. At this program I was able to make a Raspberry Pi WIFI enabled camera that uploaded every single picture you took onto Dropbox.
","When I came out of BlueStamp Engineering, all what I had left from that program was a Raspberry Pi that took pictures. Most of the code that was needed to make this camera possible came from Adafruit’s website, so I didn't really get to learn how to code or know why the camera would work the way it did. Then about a month later I got interested in home automation, so I ordered a relay and whole bunch of lights off of Amazon.com. Since I didn't get to learn how to code at BlueStamp Engineering, I really struggled on how to setup the Raspberry Pi with the relay so that it can turn on and off lights. I didn't want to give up on the project so I went to the Computer Science teacher at my school, Mr. Eiben, and he helped me start learning python. He really helped me learn a lot about python and then I finally got the relay to work. I wasn't satisfied with the project, so I went back to Mr. Eiben and he helped me start learning HTML so that I can build a website to turn on and off the room in my lights. Finally, my room is automated and I can turn on and off three different lights in my room.
","I like to work both as a part of a team and solo. It depends in the situation because if it's a really hard challenging project, I would like to work on it as group. Working in a team helps split the work between a couple of people so the work is not as stressful. If it's a project where I understand how to do it but it's just a lot of work, I would like to challenge myself and work on it by myself. Also, if i'm thinking on going above and beyond on a project like how I went above and beyond on my project by building a website, I would like to work on the project myself.

To me, computer languages are fascinating; it is almost as if I am communicating with a machine. Additionally, I love to code since I am able to take my various ideas and actually bring it to reality. I want to take what I already know and apply it in various situations. I also want to expand my knowledge-base and experience. So far, on my own time, I worked with computer software development (mainly in Java) and would love to learn about other areas of computer science such as websites, robotics, apps. I also want to get a feel for the different areas of the field since I am considering computer science as something I want to study in college.","Technology, in general, is a captivating subject. It is amazing what humans are able to do – I think it shows our strive for greatness. I am really interested in computers and robotics. For example, some of the recent developments in robot arms and human brain-machine interactions really excites me, not only because I find the subject fascinating, but also it makes me think about the possibilities of the future.","If money were no object, I would love to study at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. I would like to study Physics and Computer Science. I am a very curious person and as a young boy, I would think and ask about various questions regarding how everything works. I find Physics very interesting and would like to learn more about how the universe works. I would also like to continue my study and work on Computer Science since this is one of my passions. However, the reality is that money is a factor; it is not enough for me to be accepted at MIT, I also need financial aid – whether it is through scholarship or other financial aid programs. Also, my socioeconomic status might also be an obstacle since it might be harder for me to get access to opportunities.","Last summer, I worked at a company called ChessNYC, where I taught chess classes at one of ChessNYC’s summer camp locations. I had to teach chess to children of various ages, youngest being at four and oldest being twelve. There I was also responsible for supervising the children at all times, especially during recess and lunch time. I love chess; it is one of passions and I am really engaged in it. It was very wonderful that I was able to work on something that I love do to. Additionally, this was my first job and it really taught me important facets of professionalism and showed me what a certain job environment might look like. Additionally, I was able to work with Grandmaster Mark Paragua and National Master Majur Juac to not only improve my strength at the game but also learn about how to teach chess at in an engaging manner while being instructional.","At the beginning of the school year during first semester, in our school all sophomores are requires to take a semester course in Poetry as their literature class. However. I have to admit, I am not very good at reading poetry. On top of that, I found the class to be very hard since I felt that when we are talking about poetry, much of what we say about a poem is very subjective and depends on one’s interpretation; thus tones and metaphors depend on how an individual sees them. Soon I found myself struggling in that subject since I did not have much experience with poetry to begin with. However, I realized that I needed help and went to my teacher on a regular basis to discuss what we were doing in class. I also made regular meetings with my teacher every time we had to write an essay to polish my ideas about the poem.","I am very adaptive and can work individually and in a team. I personally do not have a preference. I enjoy working with others because you hear about other people’s ideas and a team interaction can be enjoyable. You find out about your teammates and through collaboration you can create something easily and faster than an individual working by himself/herself. However, a team environment could be hard to manage and it might be hard to work with many different ideas. There are both pros and cons to working in a team.

People’s everyday lives become increasingly reliant on technology and I want to be a part of this rapidly advancing world. ,"MIT would be my first choice (Columbia at a close second) because it is the top notch college in terms of technology.  As great as this college is, tuition and living expenses would prove to be too great of a burden. My dream job is becoming a computer programmer.  I’ve been interested in computer programming ever since I played my first video game.  It fascinates me to think about how something intangible like a website or a video game could sell and appeal to so many people.","Last summer I participated in a program through Prep for Prep called, “An Introduction to Entrepreneurship”.  Throughout the three week program, we had to form and present a business idea that had a high chance of being successful and we had to plan out all the details including potential advertising prices and the annual revenue.  I think this program will really help out in the future because when I move into the programming department, I will have to be able to successfully advertise my program and to make sure that it will have a successful output.
","During the “Introduction to Entrepreneurship”, we had to come up with an idea/product that we would use for the duration of the program.  I had a grasp of what my product would be but I felt like I needed a bigger platform to judge my product, so I made a survey addressed to family, friends and people who were involved in entrepreneurship. Through the survey, I chose my final product and I was able to improve it so that it could successfully meet the customer’s demands. ","It depends on the situation.  I prefer working solo on new subjects because by doing all of the components by yourself, you would learn and understand the concept better than if you were working in a group.  When you’re creating something or working on something that you’ve learned already, I think it’s better to work in a group because you have a wider variety of opinions that you can draw from and add to your own.

Also Common Core was recently placed in the School's Curriculum and it is harder than what it used to be and to compensate for the difficulty we should help the younger students be accustomed to the changes and help them overcome any obstacle.,"A time which I struggled for something was during  the Shotput season of my School. Compared to the other kids they were twice my size and they seemed very strong and failure wasn't an option but that's all I seemed to do at the Track Meets. I couldn't do well as the others because their our difference in strength was too large. But my coach noticed something, he told me that gaining Strength wasn't the only way to do well in Shotput but technique was an even bigger factor. From that point on I would work on my stance and release during practice while the others were in the gym bulking up. The next meet all my hard work had paid off, my coach told me my technique was flawless and because of that I ended placing 1st. My first time ever, my teammates were baffled because they were all stronger than me. What I learned from this experience was that if there's a will, there's a way.",I prefer working as part of a team because I am not limited to only my perspective but I get insight of my partners views and can incorporate their ideas into the project.,4,Yes,mokos555@yahoo.com,242188050,mokos555@yahoo.com,Tiemoko Soumano,Tiemoko Soumano,,checked,1,Tiemoko Soumano,MLB,0,8,8,EmAlert,"HTML, CSS, JS, Xcode SDK, Swift, IOS","Focus, quickly asks for help instead of problem-solving",Game Dev.,Went out of his way to learn another language and made a working IOS app.,Focus,Tech,Tech,1

One of the main reasons I’m interested in joining is because technology is the future. In today world everyone always have a piece of technology around them whether its there smartphone, tablet, watches, or laptops. Technology is advancing so fast its unreal. Now you can use your phone to text, call, surf the web, and even purchase things from stores. . Another reason I’m interested in joining is because there are many jobs available that revolve around technology.  Those jobs are high paying and not many African Americans have those jobs. Some jobs include working at Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
","
What really excites me about technology is how it’s always advancing. A portable watch five to ten years ago was known as being advance in technology, but today we have watches that are touchscreen and you can keep track of what you’re eating and your health. You can also make phone calls with them. A particular area in technology that currently peaked my interest is Virtual reality (VR). VR seems to be the next big thing in the 21st century.  VR is now starting to be use for entertainments such as video games and to enhance how you watch your TV. I’m interested in VR because it’s something new and fresh. I believe that in the next ten years everyone will be using VR in his or her homes.
","If money were no option the college I would want to go to would be Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. I would want to go to Brown because my older brother is an alumni at Brown. As of now, I don’t know what I would be studying. An obstacle is that I can be a procrastinator, which causes me to do many assignments last minute causing me to not always do my best.    Because of this, I don’t always give everything I do 100% even though I know I am very smart. If I begin to put more effort into everything I do I will become a better person and can get into the college of my choice","

Last summer I went on a trip to St. Martin in the Caribbean with my older brother and my nephew. We went to visit my aunt, uncle, and cousins who live on the island that we haven’t seen in about ten years. This was a very important trip because family is important and you should always be connected with all of your family members. During this trip I met my two younger cousins (girls) who barely understood English and only spoke French. It was very challenging to communicate with them. My nephew who was 8 at the time was around there age, spent a lot of time playing with them. It was interesting to watch him learn how to communicate with them .The time we actually did communicate was when we were playing Mario on their Wii U. Even though we didn’t understand each other, technology brought us closer.
","Over the past year I have struggle with a difficult school subject. The subject I struggle with is geometry. Before geometry, I use to love math. Math would me my favorite subject alongside history. But even since I been taking geometry, I know longer enjoy math the same way. What I find challenging about geometry is you have to do a number of steps before actually solving a problem, while I’m use to just solving the problem. What I’m doing to better myself in geometry now is asking questions in class. I don’t consider myself a vocal person so when I ask question I’m stepping out of my comfort zone.
","This question is a little difficult for me to answer. Being an 11th grade student and having to sometimes work in-group settings, I quickly realize group settings don’t always work. Not everyone is reliable in-group work; so I feel it’s best to work by myself. Base on my experiences, I prefer working solo instead of working in a team. While working solo you don’t have to depend on other people to do their part in the group. Working solo is also better for me because I can avoid side conversation that prevents the work from being completed. I don’t mind working in groups however. I prefer only working in groups with people I know and are focus. If I can trust them I know that they can get their part done without any distractions.

All Star Code, in my opinion, will be one of the top programs to meet this high demand. A friend once told me that everything is related to code somehow. In addition, coding is a ""gateway"" to other fields of study. All Star Code will not only guide me to my goal of one day perusing a career in computers, but it will also supply me skills usable in a variety of other fields.   ","Technology, for me, is way to express myself. Technology has not only revolutionized the world, but it has changed my life in unexplainable ways. It has opened doors in my life that would've not been opened if I wasn't into technology. The specific area of technology that I am interested in is cyber security. Cyber Security, in a sense, keeps technology ""alive"". Cyber security ensures the safety of the various types of technology that we hold so dearly in our hearts. ","I would attend the NYU Tandon School of Engineering with a major of Cyber Security. In my opinion, cyber security is one of the most important jobs in the world. In a world where we can't live without technology, we need people to keep it safe, and I would like to be one of those people that makes a change in society. Some obstacles that may prevent me from achieving this goal include the difficulty of actually learning how to keep our technology safe, and the amount of sacrifices that are needed to work in this field. ","Last summer, I was apart of the Applied Research Innovations in Science and Engineering (ARISE) program at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering. In this program, I was a research assistant to a masters student in Civil Engineering. I worked in the Soil Mechanics and Structural Analysis laboratory studying pile penetration. In addition to this, I took two college level classes, Basic Robotics to Inspire Scientific Knowledge (BRISK) and Dimensions of Scientific Inquiry (DSI). In BRISK, I studied different aspects that go into the construction and programming of a robot. In this class, I learned robot programming and construction using Lego EV3. In DSI, we talked about ethics and how they play a crucial role in science. We were encouraged to ask questions like ""Why is that thing done?"" and ""Is that right?"". This summer in particular was very inspirational and life changing due the knowledge and experience I was able to obtain while working in the laboratory. It also gave me a small taste of what college will be like for me in the future since the classes that I took were taught by actual college professors. However, one of the biggest reasons this past summer was amazing was due to the people that I met. I made lifelong friends, and networked with college officials that can change my life in the future to come.","In my sophomore year of high school, my hardest class, undoubtedly, was Algebra 2/Trigonometry. One of the main reasons why I felt this class was hard was because it mixed Algebra 2 and Trigonometry into one class. Another reason why I felt the class was hard was because the end of year test, called the regents, was the hardest regents out of all the other subjects. To solve this issue, I studied as much as I can in order to pass the class and also pass the regents exam. In the end, I passed both the class and the regents due to hard work and dedication of my teacher.","Working as a part of team and working solo both have their pros and cons. However, in my opinion, I feel that the benefits of working with a team far outweighs that of working solo. Working on a team allows for multiple opinions to be made on a certain topic. For example, if a group of people were working on a project, they can all give their input. This allows for different things to be uncovered, like, for example, a new perspective on that certain project. This certain perspective would not have been uncovered if someone was working solo on the project.",6,Yes,,241049119,vicente.gomez0024@gmail.com,Vicente Gomez,Vicente Gomez,,,1,Vicente Gomez,Google,3,7,8,Dispute,"HTML, CSS, JS, front and back-end",Loner,Engineer or businessman,,Loner,Non-Tech,Tech,0

Technology to me is this whole new world where you can create and even destroy whatever you want. You can let your imagination run wild. I want to be the next person that creates that new app everyone wants to download and use. I envision myself being the guy that makes a new component for a computer that is useful to everyone. That’s how I aim to revolutionize technology. Technology is always growing and new ideas are always coming to light. I want to learn about a field that is always changing and revolutionizing, and technology is that field. I want to make a difference in technology and make my mark for the rest of history.
","What really excites me about technology is the video game industry. Video games are full of imagination and creativity, both things that I completely love. To sit for months making a new world with whatever you dream of having in it is fascinating. Video games are  where you make dreams come to life and express yourself in a whole new way. It's like your own getaway island. Currently there are not many particular areas I would be fully committed to because the technology industry is so big. However, computer coding, computer engineering and video game designer really interest me right now.
","I would go to Full Sail University to study game design and business. Full Sail’s  game design department is great, and certainly a place where I could work with creative people to make the next best video game. This college would also be perfect because of its business department. If I would want to start a company about video game design or anything in the computer science industry, I could study both fields at Full Sail and become an expert. LinusTechTips, a widely known YouTuber, would be my inspiration for this because he started his own company on computer engineering. If I were to start a company I would most likely make it a computer science research center where many great minds can come together and make innovative things like artificial intelligence, robotic body parts and much more.  In All Star Code I will be able to hone my skills and interests and I want to take advantage of this opportunity.

The only obstacle that could prevent me from accomplishing that dream is being a hispanic minority. This is an obstacle because as a minority I'm not exposed to as many programs and opportunities as others are. Minorities like me are usually not hired to many jobs because we usually do not have as much exposure to a particular career path like majorities do. Coming upon an opportunity like All Star Code Summer Intensive is great for me as an Hispanic minority. Nevertheless I will not let this prevent me from becoming successful and accomplishing my life goals.
","Last summer I got accepted into a program called the Opportunity Network, which is a six year college preparatory program that helps low income students in New York get internships and great opportunities to go to college. During the Summer Institute for this program, I learned about networking, which helps you get jobs and internships,  and how to be more professional. It was important to me because I also got to meet 102 more students that share many of the same passions and dreams as I do.
","At the beginning of this school year, I struggled with my first AP class I have ever taken in American History. I was never an expert in history but I wanted to challenge myself, so I took the course. It was very challenging because I had to combine many of my interpretation skills, reading comprehension skills, and my knowledge of America all into one. I struggled with the first couple of exams because I never did anything that difficult. However, after a lot of time spent studying, going online, reading, and analyzing AP questions and text,  I got accustomed to the type of questions my teacher was asking me and my grades in that class really improved significantly. I later applied this method of studying to other classes that I was struggling in, like chemistry. I am not use to struggling in subjects but I found a method and it works for me. I also learned that I can be very productive when I take extra time out of my day to study certain subjects that I struggle in. ","I prefer to work as part of a team. In the computer science industry, no one project is done by one person. It is usually done with a team. In a team, you can coordinate and put everyone in that team to work on the project. Everyone has strengths and weaknesses;  hopefully, everyone on your team would be able to supplement your weaknesses with their strengths. I would also prefer to work as part of a team because it is less work on you if everyone on the team is doing their part and you are doing yours.

Overall, All Star Code is a revolutionary program and I would be delighted to be a part of.","Technology is forever changing the world. Whether the technology in as impactful as the internet or any minuscule as the selfie stick, technology has an important significance in society and pioneers in any technological field are remembered for their ingenuity and creativity. I feel that with proper training and enrichment I could be one of these individuals. Maybe even one day surpass them. I am interested in a career in engineering and a summer program teaches computer science could be very beneficial to my life plan. I’ve enjoyed building things for as long as I can remember. From blocks to Legos to scale models to computers, I have enjoyed constructing contraptions. The school I currently attend, Union County Academy for Information Technology, increased my interest in a career in an engineering field and I hope All Star Code can peak my interest.","If money was no object I would like to go to Stanford University in California. I would like to study mechanical engineering. Like I previously stated, I have always been passionate about a career where designing and constructing projects is a main factor. That is why I want to study mechanical engineering at Stanford University. Stanford’s engineering program is exceptional and would properly prepare me for a career in engineering. Stanford’s engineering program is also known worldwide for producing students on the forefront of new engineering technology. However, this would be an ideal case. In real life, money is a major obstacle in this plan. Money isn’t even the first obstacle in my plan. Getting accepted to Stanford is also extremely difficult. Nonetheless, I plan on trying to get into Stanford and getting into All Star Code could be the first step in this plan.","During my last summer vacation, I did various activities to prepare myself for college. I took trips to Lehigh, Stevens, Rutgers, NJIT and RIT. I took tours and attended open houses at all the aforementioned colleges. They provided me with crucial information in my college search. I didn’t work at a job during the summer but I rather focused on learning new skills. I learned HTML using code academy and rudimentary Mandarin using various online sources. I believe this is important because both languages will be extremely helpful in future job prospects. I took a Mandarin class in 7th and 8th grade and during the summer I realized that I retained very little from the class. So, I decided to dedicate part of my summer to relearning the Mandarin I learned. While I am still far away from being fluent in Mandarin, I am improving everyday","I have struggled various times in my academic studies. One such example is when I had to present a conversation in Spanish. I hate presentations in general and a presentation in Spanish was my worst nightmare. I spent the whole weekend prior to the presentation studying my lines. It was extremely difficult and the day of the presentation, I learned horrifying news. My partner for the presentation had failed to memorize any of his lives. Rather than cursing my luck, I decided to try to remedy the situation. I had to help him learn all his lines before we presented. Luckily, we had Spanish as the last period of the day. I had to practice with him throughout the day. It was extremely tedious but necessary. We had just barely finished performing the script correctly when the class started. We somehow managed to receive a 95 for our project. I know this event is not the most devastating but it was very disheartening when it transpired. This experience made me realize something. Even if you prepare for something, events out of your control may hamper your attempts. However, the way you react to the situation shows true character.","While working individually may prove beneficial for small scale projects, working as part of a team has significant advantages in major projects. Working as a team allows people of multiple backgrounds and forms of processing data to join together for a common goal. However, I have noticed that working as a team can have some drawbacks. If a team member refuses to participate or if team members cannot agree about a way to resolve a problem, the team will not accomplish anything of worth.

By attending the All Star Summer Intensive program, I can gain the tools I need to begin my future career as a video games developer. I want to follow this career because video games bring me so much joy just from playing them.  Therefore, I want to go in depth and actually learn how to make them. For example, I want to help create NBA 2K because that is my favorite game. I love how the graphics, player movements, and overall quality of the game have improved. I also want to pursue a technology career because the world is moving in the direction geared toward technology and computer science.

I want to contribute to the team that creates the video game I love playing so much. It is difficult to gain admission into USC. The university only accepts approximately seventeen percent of applicants. This is an obstacle because it is extremely competitive but I am going to give it a shot and apply there when the time comes. I would not let being rejected from USC deter me from achieving my goals. I would keep going because I am not going to let anything stop me from pursuing my dreams. I can study computer science at other universities and learn how to create computer code.","Last summer I worked for the Read Alliance program in New York City. The Read Alliance gives teens the opportunity to tutor elementary school children. The job lasted from the very beginning of July until the end of August. Working at the Read Alliance was important to me because it taught me life lessons such as patience, sticking to a difficult task, and giving back to others. Teaching young children to read can be frustrating at times. Throughout the summer, I learned to develop patience while working with the young students. This was a really valuable lesson. Early on, I considered giving up on my Read Alliance job because I was not sure I had the personality for the job.  However, I knew it would be worth it in the long run to stick with what I started. I was doing something productive by helping others. Also, giving back to others gives me a good feeling. Giving back was what I did while working for the Read Alliance whether I realized it or not at the time.","During the first semester of my junior year, I struggled with pre-calculus. This subject was completely new to me. At first, I did not understand any of the work. Although my grade was low, I did not seek help. I did not know what to do and I was really confused. One day, I shared with my pre-calculus teacher, Mr. Gramlich, I wanted to be a game developer. He told me he really liked my goal and he was going to help me achieve it. This motivated me! I believe it brought Mr. Gramlich and me closer. I became more trusting of him. I found out Mr. Gramlich taught another pre-calculus section during my study hall period. I started attending both my pre-calculus class and the other section’s class too. Some days I would  get three pre-calculus classes on days there was a double period class. I go to a boarding school and the teachers are on duty in the dorms. Mr. Gramlich was on duty every Wednesday night. I would visit him for at least an hour to get more help while he was on duty. My performance improved in class. I even woke at 5:30 a.m. some days to study and review homework. My quarter grade in pre-calculus increased by thirteen points after all my efforts. I am proud of that accomplishment.
","I enjoy a combination of both working solo and working with others. I like to start working solo and then ask for feedback and help as I go along. I prefer to work solo and get help when needed because I can focus better when I work by myself. When I do homework, it is good for me to isolate myself so I can concentrate. I benefit from avoiding distractions. However, I have learned that my ideas are better when I get feedback.
